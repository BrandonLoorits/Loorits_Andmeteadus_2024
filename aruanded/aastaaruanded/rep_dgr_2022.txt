Statement of management`s responsibility AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 7 / 61 CEO statement In the past year, we have successfully continued the development of DelfinGroup and fulfilled our mission to create and provide innovative and custom financial solutions for every client. We aim to be a leader in the fast-growing, dynamic, and changing financial technology industry, attracting the most vital talent and offering widely used and modern financial products. We provide our customers with customized online and face-to-face services, allowing citizens to choose more understandable and convenient ways of receiving services. DelfinGroup has always paid increased attention to making our services available to the widest possible part of society, including in the regions of Latvia. Although the year 2022 began with the gradual easing of pandemic restrictions, DelfinGroup was able to resume complete face-to-face services, which allowed us to look hopefully into the future, on February 24 of last year, the whole world was shaken by the news of Russia's start of a full-scale war in Ukraine. Russia's invasion of the neighbouring country caused a global energy crisis, which resulted in an economic recession, inflation, and uncertainty in the business environment. This meant adapting to the new situation in the Group’s main business segments. Digitalization was developed in the pawn lending segment, an online store was renewed in the retail trade segment, and data science was improved in the consumer loan segment for more effective customer evaluation. One of our strategic ambitions is to promote the circulation of pre-owned goods, promoting the circular economy culture in society. We have concluded that our society is still developing the habit of reusing goods, thus reducing consumption and encouraging thoughtful use of natural resources. An overwhelming majority of Latvian residents continue to keep items in their households that are not used and that could be put into circulation, maximizing the value of the goods and increasing their life cycle thus lowering CO2 emissions. It is essential to strengthen new habits in our society regarding the further use of pre-owned goods, to create an appropriate infrastructure and system that would motivate people to get involved and become a crucial part of the circular economy. That is why the Banknote concept developed by DelfinGroup offers both in-person and remotely the opportunity to sell or buy valuable things for secondary use. We have created Lietots. Pārbaudīts initiative, within the framework of which every item that enters the Banknote store is professionally checked and, if necessary, repaired. This initiative allows us to offer a guarantee on every item we sell. The efficiency of Banknote's environmentally friendly business model, which we have chosen and purposefully developed, can be seen in the high demand for new and pre-owned goods. Thanks to this, we are actively developing another business line purchasing of goods. We look for suppliers, cooperate with international partners, and buy goods from private individuals to offer a wide assortment of goods to our branch and online store customers. Considering the unique advantages and global trends, DelfinGroup aims to become the primary ambassadors of the circular economy in the region, promoting the circulation of pre-owned and slightly pre-owned goods and the rational use of resources and creating public awareness of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. By introducing solutions appropriate to the era, in 2022, we have renewed the online store for the sale of pre-owned and tested goods veikals.Banknote.lv. It is one of the largest circular economy online stores in Latvia and throughout the Baltics, with more than 45 000 tested goods. Although one of the strategic priorities of the Group is business digitalization, we are purposefully developing both directions both online and in-person services. To promote the strengthening of circular economy principles in trade, in 2022, we continued to improve the Banknote circular economy store network. At the same time, the development of the branch network is also promoted by society's high demand for convenient financial services and in-person trade of pre-owned goods, contrary to the general tendency to close various types of service provision locations. We see that the demand for face-to-face services remains high, especially in the regions of Latvia, where the availability of various services is generally limited. There are more than 90 Banknote financial service and product sales points in Latvia, with a comprehensive representation directly in regions and small towns. In some places, our branches are the only or one of the few dealers of electrical goods and jewellery and, at the same time, a financial services institution. Management report AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 8 / 61 There is a feeling of a job well done regarding the achieved business results. In 2022, DelfinGroup issued loans amounting to 80.3 million euros, which is 62% more than in 2021, while the retail of pre-owned goods increased by 27%, reaching 11.4 million euros. The results show that our operational strategy, developing versatile financial solutions, is correct. This year too, we will place great emphasis on developing the circular economy concept and trade in pre-owned goods. We assess the achieved financial results positively. They were facilitated by both the Group’s strengthened market positions in the main business segments, the demand for simple and customeroriented financial services, and our ability to adapt to the challenges of the global economy. As a result, the Group's profit before taxes increased by 45% in 2022, reaching 7.3 million euros, while revenues reached 35.8 million euros. On the other hand, the Group's loan portfolio has increased by 54% since the end of 2021, reaching 67.5 million euros. Entering the regulated market of Nasdaq Riga in 2021, DelfinGroup created a unique dividend policy for the Baltic stock market the Company promised to pay shareholders quarterly dividends of up to 50% of the quarterly profit. In 2022, we fulfilled our promise by making 6 dividend payments of more than EUR 5 million or 0.1197 euros per share, which provided the Company's shareholders with an excellent yield of 8.1%. In response to geopolitical and other external conditions, the situation in the capital markets has also changed. Without a doubt, external factors and the cost of financing the growing loan portfolio also affect DelfinGroup operations. Still, over the years, we have successfully diversified funding sources for attracting capital and gained investors' trust. Although the cost of capital is currently higher, the Group continues to raise it through bonds and an investment platform successfully. To take care of the environment, we are gradually giving preference to energy generated from renewable resources in a nature-friendly way. Thus, in 2022, DelfinGroup central office was fully supplied with green electricity. In the area of corporate governance, we continued to be open and transparent with our investors, employees, regulators, suppliers, and the wider public. For example, last year, we conducted two webinars for investors and interested parties about the Group’s financial and business results; five shareholder meetings were held, where shareholders were invited to express their opinion both in person and remotely, and we also participated in several events organized by the Fintech Latvia Association, where DelfinGroup experts shared their experience and knowledge. We aim to create a sustainable society, provide people with opportunities, and promote inclusion, diversity, equality, and well-being. We have financially supported several disadvantaged social groups seniors, children, and lowincome families for several years. For example, in 2022, we increased the donation amount to improve the opportunities for senior citizens, provided the Children's Hospital with a bicycle ergometer, and supported families in need. Responding immediately to Russia's aggression against Ukraine, from the first days of the war in February 2022, DelfinGroup actively supports Ukraine its defenders and the country's residents who suffered in the war or were forced to flee. In 2022 we have donated more than 250,000 euros to the Children's Hospital Foundation, the Entrepreneurs for Peace Foundation, and the TEV Association. The team determines the success of any company. In the past year, we have significantly strengthened the management team of DelfinGroup with strong industry professionals and have focused on increasing employee motivation. In 2022, to continue developing simple, customer-adapted, and technology-based financial services, we have created a new position Chief Innovation Manager, whose task is to promote introducing innovative fintech technology solutions in the Group to participate in the creation of strategic development. In addition, as part of the long-term employee motivation program, we introduced a staff option program to promote belonging to the Group. We value every employee's contribution to the Group’s development, so we provide the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the staff option program for employees at all job levels who have worked in the Company for at least 12 months. Now our employees will be able to earn additional wages along with the Group’s development. A total of 450 thousand Company shares will be issued as part of the program. Based on the business and financial results of 2022, as well as setting the Group’s strategic priorities and forecasts until 2025, we are in a solid position to continue the growth of DelfinGroup. I want to thank every investor, client, and employee who believed in the DelfinGroup story and continues to do so. Thank you for your trust!

Strategy DelfinGroup aims to be a leader in the fast-growing, dynamic, and changing financial technology industry by attracting the most vital talent, offering widely used and advanced financial products, and maintaining efficient and transparent management processes. By implementing and developing modern technological solutions, DelfinGroup can develop and offer modern and customer-oriented products and services with excellent user experience (UX), thereby becoming a significant market player. Furthermore, by continuing targeted technology and product development, DelfinGroup aims to become customers' first choice for financial services. DelfinGroup has already significantly changed the pawnshop industry by introducing a modern approach to providing pawnshop services. However, the goal is to further transform the pawnshop industry, which has not been the focus of digital transformation until now, and develop the pawnshop product in a digital environment, thus offering a pawn loan that meets the needs of customers, innovatively and conveniently. Therefore, we want to strengthen our leadership position and be a game changer in the pawnshop industry. Taking into account the unique advantages and global trends, DelfinGroup aims to become the main ambassador of the circular economy in the region, promoting the circulation of pre-owned and slightly pre-owned goods, introducing modern solutions in the online store and branches, as well as promoting the rational use of resources and creating public awareness of the environment-friendly lifestyle. Targets By following DelfinGroup mission of creating and providing innovative and custom financial solutions for every client, we will be able to ensure DelfinGroup long-term growth in value. By creating innovative and custom solutions for customer needs, we have achieved rapid growth in recent years, which has allowed DelfinGroup to strengthen its position in the Latvian market in all three main business segments. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 11 / 61 Management report (CONTINUED) The results achieved in 2022 confirm that the Group is operating in the right direction, which ensures stable business results. By continuing to invest in the development, DelfinGroup expects to significantly improve business results and maintain the most important indicators at a sustainable level until the end of 2025. In 2025, DelfinGroup plans to reach a net loan portfolio of 100 million euros, an average increase of 14% per year. Also, the Group plans to double both EBITDA and profit indicators by 2025. In the following years, however, DelfinGroup intends to maintain a return on equity (ROE) above 30%, an equity ratio above 20%, and a cost-to-income ratio below 45%, ensuring the Group's efficient operation. Until 2025, DelfinGroup plans to continue to ensure regular dividend payments, which would be more than 50% of the Group's annual profit within the year, similar to what has been done in 2022. 36 44 68 100 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 Net loan portfolio, mEUR 9.9 10.0 13.1 26 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 EBITDA, mEUR 5.2 5.0 7.3 15 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 Profit before tax, mEUR 48.6% 29.5% 33.5% >30.0% 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 Return on equity (ROE) 55.1% 57.3% 50.3% <45.0% 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 Cost to income ratio 21.0% 33.5% 23.5% >20.0% 2020 2021 2022 … 2025 Equity ratio AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 12 / 61 Management report (CONTINUED) Consumer lending segment At the beginning of the year, as the restrictions of Covid-19 eased, the war started by Russia in Ukraine once again created uncertainty in society and the economy. As a result, shortly after the start of the war, there was a greater caution among customers when choosing new loans. However, this trend was short-lived, and as DelfinGroup results show, customer interest in customized and innovative financial solutions remained stable. However, due to the war, rising energy prices and inflation led to adjustments in customer perceptions and habits. The most significant impact was observed in September, before the start of the new heating season, when there was a pending position in receiving consumer loans and more active repayment of existing loans. Also, due to the general increase in prices, there is a gradual increase in the requested loan amount. Continuing the trend of previous years, market consolidation was also observed last year, i.e., the departure or merger of smaller market participants, which the licensing fees of market participants in Latvia can partly explain. As a result, stable companies will strengthen the consumer loan market, improving the industry's overall reputation. Despite the unclear economic situation, the demand for loans remained strong in the consumer lending segment, which is also confirmed by the results achieved by DelfinGroup in 2022, 60.8 million euros were issued in new consumer loans, the highest result in the Group's history. Also, according to the Consumer Rights Protection Center of Latvia data, in the first half of 2022 (the latest available data), the total loan portfolio of consumer lenders had increased. However, as demand for loans remained strong, DelfinGroup followed a more prudent customer evaluation policy, financing lower-risk customers to ensure sustainable customer loan repayments and maintain a high-quality loan portfolio. Achieving notable results in the segment of consumer loans was also helped by the investments made in the digitization of products, ensuring timely receipt of services online, on the internet, as well as in the mobile application. Furthermore, a significant contribution to achieving results was also brought by initiating broader cooperation with loan comparison platforms in Latvia, creating a network of cooperation partners that ensures more effective customer reach. Also, considering customer demand, last year, the maximum loan amount for consumer loans was increased to EUR 10 000, instead of the previous EUR 7 000, while the maximum amount of the credit line was increased to EUR 5 000, instead of the previous EUR 3 000. Pawn lending segment A significant contribution to the development of the pawn lending segment in 2022 was made by the lifting of Covid19 restrictions starting on April 1, as a result of which, more than one person could stay in the face-to-face branches at the same time, as was the case during the restriction period. Until now, the face-to-face factor in the pawnshop business is essential when evaluating the product. According to the Consumer Rights Protection Centre data, the industry experienced a decline. Still, in the first half of 2022, the industry's overall growth was already observed. Like the rest of the industry, lifting Covid-19 restrictions significantly impacted the development of DelfinGroup pawn shops. Last year, pawn loans for 19.5 million euros were issued, exceeding the pre-pandemic results. Trends in the economy in 2022 also affected the pawnshop loan segment. Above all, rising commodity prices due to inflation also meant higher collateral values and loans issued against them. The pawn loan issuance against gold in 2022 is also worth noting. Considering the increasing inflation, the value of gold also increased, which became more sought-after collateral for pawn shops. As a result, loans issued against gold collateral increased almost twice compared to the previous year. Similar to the consumer lending segment, the pawnshop business in Latvia also experienced smaller pawnshops exiting the market or merging with others last year. As a result, some larger companies with a better reputation have established themselves in the market, raising the reputation of the industry and the quality of services. The year 2022 was also significant for DelfinGroup in terms of company acquisitions. At the beginning of the year, the takeover of AS Moda Kapitāls, one of the largest pawnshop chains in Latvia, was completed. DelfinGroup acquired AS Moda Kapitāls' pawnshop loan portfolio, also expanding its client base. As well as last year, a deal was concluded on the takeover of the credit portfolios of six pawnshop branches that were part of the Finance 360 pawnshop association. Among them, the loan portfolios of branches in Riga, Liepāja and Rēzekne were taken over. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 13 / 61 Management report (CONTINUED) Like other industries, the pawnshop industry is also at the forefront of digital transformation. Today, customers are less and less willing to spend time visiting the service provider in person. Therefore, implementing digitalization processes is the most critical driver of the industry in the coming years. It is digital solutions that will help the pawnshop industry to reach new customers and take a strong position among other types of loans that are currently available online. The implementation of digitalization processes has also started in DelfinGroup pawn lending segment. First, the preliminary evaluation online of the product, where the customer can determine indicative value before going to the branch, should be highlighted. In the coming years, DelfinGroup plans to digitize the full-cycle pawnshop services, as a result of which customers will be able to pledge their goods and receive a loan entirely remotely, which will open up more opportunities to grow both DelfinGroup competitiveness in this business segment and its market share. Retail of pre-owned goods segment Considering the growing public interest in the circular economy model and extending the life of goods, similar to the rest of DelfinGroup business segments, the retail of pre-owned and slightly pre-owned goods segment also experienced significant growth in 2022. The sale of goods, including the sale of pledges taken over at the pawnshop, reached 11.4 million euros, a 27% increase compared to 2021. In general, 2022 is the year of recovery of the retail segment after the restrictions of Covid-19. Customer interest is returned after visiting brick-and-mortar stores to view and test products in person before making a purchase. However, the DelfinGroup business model is suitable for such changes in customer habits, as the traded goods are available in the vast network of Banknote branches and in the online store. Thus DelfinGroup is accessible to a broader range of customers with different shopping habits. As the prices of consumer goods rose last year, customers had to think more about their purchases, as the cost of covering basic needs increased significantly. However, against this background, the demand for used and tested goods offered by DelfinGroup remained stable, and customers appreciated the opportunity to buy the necessary goods at a lower price. A significant contribution was also made by developing the circular economy and public awareness of extending the life of goods. Consequently, people began to choose more sustainable solutions for purchasing goods, supporting the development of the green course. In 2022, the retail trade segment of pre-owned goods remained the focus of DelfinGroup activity. Last year, the most important work was done on the Banknote online store, which was renewed. As a result, the user experience on this page was improved, as well as various other solutions were created that will ensure the competitiveness of the online store in the future, such as by expanding payment options, card acceptance was introduced, as well as delivery options using parcel lockers of cooperation partners, which are available throughout the territory of Latvia, facilitating the purchase of goods. In previous years, the primary sources of acquisition of pre-owned and slightly pre-owned goods for DelfinGroup were the purchase of goods directly from the customer, as well as the realization of unredeemed pawn loan pledges, while in 2022, work began on expanding cooperation with various cooperation partners (business-to-business), from which bought slightly used and sometimes even new products that customers returned to them within the fourteen day return period, or demo products that were displayed in dealer stores for testing. The expansion of this type of cooperation ensures that the quantity of high-quality and relatively new goods at Banknote branches and the online store increases at more favourable prices than if customers bought them new. Investor information DelfinGroup shares are listed on the Baltic Main List in Nasdaq Riga with ISIN code LV0000101806. 2022 was the first full calendar year in which DelfinGroup shares were available for free trade.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group had 91 branch in 38 cities in Latvia (31.12.2021 93 branches in 38 cities). Risk management The Group is not exposed to foreign exchange rate risk because the basic transaction currency is the Euro. Majority of the funding of the Group consists of fixed coupon rate bonds and loans, so that the Group is not exposed to variable interest rate risk. Accurate application of the prudent strategies chosen has allowed the Group to successfully manage its financial risks, particularly the liquidity and credit risk. All Group transactions are performed in Latvia, the Group has no counterparties in Russia and Belarus thus the impact of the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions has insignificant effect on the Company’s operations. Distribution of the profit proposed by the Company As the Company paid out 50% of the net profit of each quarter in 2022 quarterly dividends, the Management Board proposes to allocate the Group's net profit of 2022 to retained earnings. The Corporate Governance Report and the Remuneration Report for 2022 has also been submitted to AS Nasdaq Riga together with this separate and consolidated Annual Financial Report for year ended 31 December 2022 by AS DelfinGroup.

Although these estimates are based on the information available to the management regarding the current events and actions, the actual results may differ from the estimates used. Critical assumptions and judgements are described in the relevant sections of the Notes to the financial statements.

The following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. — IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. — Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1). — Definition of Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8). — Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2). — Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. Restatement in comparative figures due to correction of errors (a) The Management has identified a classification error on pawn loans while preparing Group’s financial statements. The error relates to incorrect classification of pawn loans as Inventory and related sales of collateral as Net sales. The error resulted in overstatement of the Group’s and the Company’s Net sales by EUR 1 140 031, Cost of sales by EUR 805 281 in statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021 and Inventory by EUR 694 792 in balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 and by EUR 681 817 in balance sheet as of 1 January 2021 and understatement of Interest income and similar income by EUR 334 750 in statement of profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2021and Loans and receivables by EUR 694 792 in balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 and by EUR 681 817 in balance sheet as of 1 January 2021. (b) In these financial statements, the Group and the Company has improved ECL calculation model. The Group and the Company have included defaults from debt sale before payments are past due for more than 90 days in probability of default calculation. Model improvement resulted in an identified understatement of Credit loss expenses by EUR 417 660 (EUR 176 927 for the Company) in statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021, overstatement of Loans and receivables by EUR 387 290 (EUR 128 279 for the Company) in balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 and understatement by EUR 30 370 (EUR 48 648 for the Company) in balance sheet as of 1 January 2021. (c) The Management has reconsidered the judgment in respect of pawn loan accounting and come to conclusion that pawn loans do not meet solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) requirements, thus prior period pawn loan measurement according to amortized cost were erroneous. The Group and the Company recognizes and subsequently measures pawn loans at fair value. There is no difference in comparative figures of Loans and receivables, and Interest income and similar income due to this error. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 22 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) (d) The Management has identified an error on interest revenue calculation on debt financial assets by applying effective interest rate method while preparing Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.

To comply with requirements of IFRS 9, the Group and the Company have recalculated interest income and similar income. (e) The Management has identified a classification error on accounting of e-shop sales while preparing Group’s financial statements. The error relates to incorrect recognition of e-shop markup in net sales. The error resulted in understatement of the Group’s and the Company’s Net sales by EUR 294 565, Cost of sales by EUR 294 565 in statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021. (f) In these financial statements, the Group and the Company have changed the presentation of losses from debt sales. In statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021 losses from debt sales was presented under Other operating expenses. In these financial statements, for better presentation of financial information, losses from debt sales were reclassified to Credit loss expenses. The reclassification resulted in understatement of Credit loss expenses and overstatement of Other operating expenses by EUR 165 328 (EUR 128 077 for the Company) in statement of profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2021. (g) In these financial statements, the Group and the Company have changed the short-term, long-term split of Bonds issued.

Group, are consolidated. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases. All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated in full; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. (c) Recognition of revenue and expenses Net sales Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. The transfer of control is based mainly on transferring risks and rewards according to the delivery terms. The Group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant. When, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the Group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the promised goods or services. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised. Revenue is presented net of indirect sales taxes such as value added tax, penalties and discounts. Income from sale of goods and precious metals contains sale of non-durable goods and precious metals at Group’s branch network and on-line shop. Other income includes revenue from the provision of pawnshop services – commission income on storage and sale of non-performing pawn loan collateral. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 28 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) Interest income and similar income The Group calculates interest revenue on debt financial assets measured at amortized cost by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than credit-impaired assets. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest revenue or expense. When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired, the Group calculates interest revenue by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost of the financial asset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts to calculating interest revenue on a gross basis. For purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, the Group calculates interest revenue by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The credit adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortised cost of the POCI assets. The Group calculates interest income on pawn loans by applying the nominal interest rate to the gross carrying amount of pawn loan asset. Interest income is calculated for the performing pawn loan portfolio and is stopped at the moment when pawn loan become non-performing. Interest expenses and similar expenses The effective interest rate of a financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of financial liability. In calculating interest expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating-rate instruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest. Other income Other income is recognised based on accruals principle and when the services have been rendered. Expenses Expenses are recognised based on accruals principle in the period of origination, irrespective of the moment of payment. (d) Foreign currency All transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date of the respective transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement of the respective period. At the balance sheet date the rates set by the Bank of Latvia were: 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 1 EUR 1 EUR USD 1.07 1.13 (e) Fair value measurement ‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the difference, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 29 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. Where, in the opinion of the Management, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities differ materially from their book values such fair values are separately disclosed in the notes to the accounts. See also note 30. (f) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (g) Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Short‑term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Share-based payment arrangements The grant‑date fair value of equity‑settled share‑based payment (SBP) arrangements granted to employees is generally recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non‑market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non‑market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share‑based payment awards with non‑vesting conditions, the grant‑date fair value of the share‑based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true‑up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. (h) Intangible assets (including goodwill) All intangible assets are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets are recorded at historic cost net of amortization and permanent diminution in value. The Group has a detailed intangible assets capitalisation policy covering accounting for development projects. The Group incurs costs for development of software and similar items, which may be capitalized. Capitalized expenditure can be either purchased or internally developed. Only those assets are capitalised that are separately identifiable, they are controlled by the Group, for which probable future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group, and cost exceeds the minimum threshold (150 EUR) set by the Group shall be recognized. No intangible asset costs arising from the research phase of a project are capitalized. Expenditure on research is expensed when incurred. Amortisation commences once the item is in the location and conditions necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and has been accepted by the business owner. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down each asset to its estimated residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: years Patents, trademarks and similar rights 3 – 5 Other intangible assets (including software) 3 – 5 Internally developed software 3 – 5 Goodwill is initially measured at cost and arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries being the excess of the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised in profit or loss statement immediately. The recognised goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. Any impairment expense is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss statement. If subsidiaries are disposed, gains or losses on the disposal include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiary sold. The residual values, remaining useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed and, if required, adjusted annually. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 30 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) (i) Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historic cost net of depreciation and permanent diminution in value. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down each asset to its estimated residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: years Buildings and structures 20 Other fixed assets 3 – 5 Leasehold improvements 1 – 19 Right-of-use premises 1 – 19 Right-of-use vehicles 3 – 4 The residual values, remaining useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed and, if required, adjusted annually. Property, plant and equipment recognition is terminated in case of its liquidation or when no future benefits are expected in connection with the utilisation of the respective asset. Any profit or loss connected with the termination of recognition (calculated as difference between the disposal gains and net book value as at the moment of derecognition), is recognised in the profit or loss account in the period when derecognition occurs. Leasehold improvements are written down on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvement and the term of the lease. Current repairs and maintenance costs are charged to profit and loss account in the period when the respective costs are incurred. (j) Investments in the subsidiaries and associated companies in the separate financial statements In the financial statements the investments in subsidiary companies (SIA ViziaFinance as at 31 December 2022) are carried at cost less impairment. Cost represents consideration paid for acquisition of subsidiaries as well as additional contributions to share capital of subsidiaries. Impairment is defined as the difference between the cost and recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of the respective asset's fair value less the costs to sell and the value in use. (l) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories are measured using the FIFO method. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that inventories are impaired and makes provisions for slow-moving or damaged inventories. Inventories loss is recognised in the period such loss is identified, writing off the relevant inventory values to the period profit and loss account. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. (m) Trade and other receivables Unsecured loans Accounts receivable comprise loans and other receivables (other debtors, advances and deposits) that are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. All loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers and derecognised on repayments. Loans are initially measured at their fair value. The Group subsequently measures consumer loans at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: ► The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; ► The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI). The Group is using a model for the recognition of impairment losses – the expected credit losses (ECL) model. There is a ‘three stage’ approach which is based on the change in credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. In practice, the rules mean that entities will have to record an immediate loss equal to the 12-month ECL on initial recognition of financial assets that are not credit impaired (or lifetime ECL for trade receivables). Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk, impairment is measured using lifetime ECL rather than 12-month ECL. The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows: • PD The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio. • EAD The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. • LGD The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 31 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) The expected credit loss is calculated as a function of PD, the exposure at default EAD and the loss given default LGD. • PD ratio is calculated as proportion of historic loan portfolio amount of loans that reaches the number of past due more than 90 days or have been sold in debt sales. • LGD calculation is based on recovered funds for loans over 90 days or loans that have been sold in debt sales. Recovered funds are discounted using the monthly effective interest rate. The IFRS 9 impairment model uses a three-stage approach depending on whether the claim is performing or not and if the claim is performing, whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. 1. Stage 1 – 12-month ECL applies to all existing claims, which have no signs of significant increase in credit risk. ECL will be computed using 12-month PD that represents the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months. For those assets with a remaining maturity of less than 12 month, a PD is used that corresponds to remaining maturity. 2. Stage 2 – applies to claims, which have sign/(s) of a significant increase in credit risk (delay days > 30 days but less than 90 days or restructuring). The standard requires the computation of ECL based on lifetime PD that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining estimated life of the financial asset. Provisions are higher in this stage because of an increase in risk and the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1. Restructured loans are kept in stage 2 for two successful payments after the restructuring, which is assessed to be sufficient period to reflect absence of significant increase in credit risk vis-à-vis original credit risk. 3. Stage 3 – Financial assets are recognized in Stage 3 when there is objective evidence that the loan is impaired (delay days > 90 days). Similar to Stage 2, the allowance for credit losses will continue to capture the lifetime ECL. A settlement delay of 30 or more days is assessed based on their actual occurrence. The rest of the signs of increased risk and their impact have to be analysed case by case and the change in a customer`s risk level has to be made based on management`s judgement. This assessment is symmetrical in nature, allowing the credit risk of financial assets to move back to Stage 1 if the increase in credit risk has decreased since origination and is no longer deemed to be significant. Default or the possibility of it occurring in the future and can be divided into the following events: • Improbability of receiving payments. Based on objective evidence, it may be presumed that the client will be unable to settle all of the financial obligations and the situation cannot be solved satisfactorily. • Payment delay. The contract is deemed to be non-performing if the client is no longer able or willing to fulfil payment obligations, e.g. upon any of the following events: (a) payments are past due for more than 90 days; (b) the client does not respond to the payment reminders and the desire to contact; (c) the client is bankrupt or deceased; (d) identity theft has been identified, i.e. misuse of the credit receiver`s identity. The Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECLs in order to identify if there has been significant increase in credit risk. If there is an increase, relevant adjustments to ECL are made. When loans cannot be recovered, they are written off and charged against allowances for loan impairment losses. They are not written off until all the necessary legal procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss is finally determined. The Group signed a contract with a third party for the receivable amounts regular debt sale to assign debtors for loans issued. Losses from these transactions were recognised in the current period under other operating expenses. The recoverability of other debtors, advances and deposits paid is valued on individual basis if there are any indications of net book value of the asset exceeding its recoverable amount. Any ECL on financial assets other than loan portfolio and loans to related companies is not significant. Pawn loans Pawn loans are non-recourse loans secured against a collateral (the pledge). If the customer does not redeem the collateral by repaying the secured loan before the end of the contract, the Group is entitled to dispose of the goods to cover the outstanding balance of the loan. Pawn loans are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers and derecognised on the repayment for performing loans or sale of the collateral for non-performing loans. Considering that that pawnshop loans do not meet the SPPI criteria, they are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value. The pawn loan portfolio is divided in two categories: performing and non-performing loan portfolios. The performing loan portfolio comprises of loans that are not yet due or loans that have been extended. The non-performing loan portfolio contains loans that have not been repaid on maturity and the payment of which depends on the realization of the collateral. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 32 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) (n) Leases Group as lessee The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Right-of-use assets The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment of the option to purchase the underlying asset. The Group does not apply IASB practical expedient on COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions and adjusts both right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when modifications of lease contracts occur. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of equipment that are considered of low value (i.e., below EUR 4.5 thousand). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. (o) Taxes The corporate income tax expense is included in the financial statements based on the management's calculations made in accordance with the requirements of Latvian tax legislation. As of 1 January 2018, Corporate Income Tax is paid on distributed and notionally distributed profits. The distributed and conditionally distributed profit is subject to a 20% gross tax or 20/80 of the net cost. Corporate income tax on dividend payments is recognized in the income statement. According to law effective 25% tax is applied to non-business related expenses. In Latvia deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized starting from 2018. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised only in case if dividends from subsidiaries are expected to be distributed. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 33 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) (p) Borrowings Initially borrowings are recognised at fair value amounting to the proceeds received net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost which is determined using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction costs and the redemption value of the borrowing is gradually recognized in the profit and loss account over the term of the borrowing. (q) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, balances of current accounts with banks and shortterm deposits with a maturity term of up to 90 days. (r) Payment of dividends Dividends due to the shareholders are recognized in the financial statements as a liability in the period in which the shareholders approve the disbursement of dividends. (s) Financial risk management (s1) Financial risk factors The activities of the Group expose it to different financial risks: (s1.1) foreign currency risk; (s1.2) credit risk; (s1.3) operational risk; (s1.4) market risk; (s1.5) liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management is focused on the uncertainty of financial markets and aims to reduce its adverse effects on the Company's financial indicators. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for financial risk management. CFO identifies, assesses and seeks to find solutions to avoid financial risks acting in close cooperation with other structural units of the Group. (s1.1) Foreign exchange risk The Group operates mainly in the local market and its exposure to foreign exchange risk is not significant. (s1.2) Credit risk The Group has a credit risk concentration based on its operational specifics – issuance of non-secured loans that is connected with an increased risk of asset recoverability. The Group’s policies are developed in order to ensure maximum control procedures in the process of loan issuance, timely identification of bad and doubtful debts and adequate provisioning for potential loss. Regarding loan unsecured loan issuance, the Group has three methods of customer identification: (i) obtaining data that accredits the identity of a natural person from a credit institution, (ii) verifying the customer's income, (iii) verifying the past and current obligations of the borrower. The Lending Company compares the information from the application form with the information received from external sources. The Group performs an automated credit check for those customers who have successfully completed the first four phases of the credit risk underwriting process. Its Risk and Data team has considerable experience in adding the optimal combination of alternative and traditional data sources, and knowledge of how to use the data collected for high-quality credit risk underwriting. The Group’s credit check involves a collection of traditional credit bureau data and income information. The Group collects data from 4-5 external sources to check the borrower’s creditworthiness and calculate the debt-to-income rate. The Group has developed a linear rule strategy to evaluate each loan application using an automated credit risk underwriting process. The Group’s credit risk underwriting models are developed by a centralized data science team. The Group develops its credit risk underwriting models based on information gathered during the customer registration, loan application, customer identification, fraud screening and credit screening phases. The Groups risk team closely monitors the quality of the data collected, validates, and verifies the completeness of the required data points. The team ensures that the credit check strategy is aligned with the settings of the credit check model, sets data requirements for each decision step, and ensures efficient data management. For pawn loans, the evaluation of the collaterals is performed by trained appraisers. The Group has established an efficient and effective debt collection process and has a dedicated team that adheres to debt collection practices that are fully compliant with local regulations. The Group have regular monthly debt sale process developed and signed a contract with a third party for unsecured loans issued which are outstanding between 30 to 90 days and there are timely identified indications that loans sold could default. For loans that are outstanding more than 90 days separate debt sale agreements are signed. In the case of pawn loans, the collateral is sold in their branches or e-shop (the average realization period of the collateral is 3 months). The table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the Balance Sheet. Exposures are based on net carrying amounts as reported in the Balance Sheet. The Group’s maximum credit exposures are shown gross, i.e. without taking into account any collateral or other credit enhancements.

Operation of the Group carries a certain operational risk which can be managed using several methods including methods to identify, analyse, report and reduce the operational risk. Also, self-assessment of the operational risk is carried out as well as systematic approval of new products is provided to ensure the compliance of the products and processes with the risk environment of the activity. (s1.4) Market risk The Group is exposed to market risks, basically related to the fluctuations of interest rates between the loans granted and funding received, as well as demand for the Group’s services fluctuations. The Group’s cash flows related to financing costs to some extent depend on the changes in market rates of interest. The Group attempts to limit market risks, adequately planning the expected cash flows, diversifying the product range and fixing funding resource interest rates. The Group issues loans at fixed rate and has borrowings with a fixed and variable rates. As at 31 December 2022 except from one bond emission in amount of EUR 4 927 000 and lease contracts amounting to 292 thousand EUR with contracts concluded in EUR currency with variable part denominate as 3 month EURIBOR rate all other interest bearing liabilities are with a fixed interest rate. The interest rate market risk is considered to be low. The following table represents the effect in the Group’s and the Company’s profit before tax (over 12-month period) on change in interest rates in by 100 basis points.

The management of the Group has an oversight responsibility of the liquidity reserves and make current forecasts based on anticipated cash flows. The management of the Group performs liquidity analysis on a regular basis and ensures adequate gap between short-term liabilities and assets. Most of the Group's liabilities are long-term liabilities. Based on performed procedures the management is of the opinion that the Group will be able to secure sufficient liquidity by its operating activities. For analysis of financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities please see note 31. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 35 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) (s2) Management of the capital structure In order to ensure the continuation of the Group's activities, while maximizing the return to stakeholders’ capital management, optimization of the debt and equity balance is performed. The Group's capital structure consists of bonds issued, third party loans and finance lease liabilities, cash and equity, comprising issued share capital, retained earnings and share premium. At year-end the ratios were as follows: Group Group Company Company 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 EUR EUR EUR EUR Bonds issued 19 113 740 10 838 165 19 113 740 10 838 165 Other borrowings 34 860 758 18 573 636 25 483 091 13 470 502 Lease liabilities 2 918 440 3 305 197 2 918 440 3 305 197 Trade payables and accrued liabilities 1 598 842 1 571 953 1 495 350 1 502 504 Taxes and social insurance 560 492 398 268 560 349 391 791 Gross debts 59 052 272 34 687 219 49 570 970 29 508 159 Cash and cash equivalents (2 369 029) (2 459 862) (2 000 924) (2 225 535) Net debts 56 683 243 32 227 357 47 570 046 27 282 624 Equity 18 105 736 17 475 982 13 844 093 15 423 320 Gross debt / equity ratio 3.26 1.98 3.58 1.91 Net debt / equity ratio 3.13 1.84 3.44 1.77 (t) Significant assumptions and estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make professional judgments, assumptions and estimates which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Assumptions and estimates based on those assumptions are analysed regularly to identify if changes are required. The changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the reporting period when the estimates were changed and in all periods that follow. Impairment losses on loans to customers The measurement of impairment losses on loans to customers requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. The Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: ► The Group’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to Stage 1 or 2; ► identification of unlikeliness to pay criteria and assignment of loans to Stage 3; ► development of ECL models, including the various formulae and the choice of inputs; ► forward-looking macroeconomic information incorporation in the ECL models; ► ECL adjustment due to decrease in debt sales; ► the modelling and calculation of key parameters of the ECL models, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD). To enhance ECL models the Group uses forward-looking macroeconomic information, which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic drivers and how these drivers will affect each other. As the Group operates only in Latvia all data of macroeconomic indicators published on monthly basis by Central Statistical Bureau Republic of Latvia was obtained, equalized, and compared with the Group’s year on year 1– 30-day delay to non-delay portfolio. This was used as a proxy for probability of default. Indicators with highest correlation are salary, number of employed persons aged 15-74 and economic sentiment index. Based on obtained data a regression model was created, which offers significance of the coefficient of each macroeconomic indicator. To use macroeconomic factor as forward-looking macroeconomic information adjustment three economic scenarios with distinct economic consequences were used: a base case scenario which comprises most likely future economic development, a less likely adverse scenario and less likely optimistic scenario. The key variables are summarized below. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 36 / 61 Notes (continued) (1) Accounting policies (continued) Base case scenario Adverse scenario Optimistic scenario Nominal gross salary (yearly changes) 9.20% 8.28% 10.12% Number of employed persons aged 15-74 1.00% (4.00)% 6.00% Economic sentiment index (yearly changes) (7.70)% (36.76)% 0.00% The current implementation, based on an expert judgement, weights base case scenario with 60% likelihood, the adverse scenario at 20% likelihood and the optimistic scenario at 20% likelihood. If the weighting of the adverse scenario was to increase to 45%, the expected credit loss allowance of the Group would increase by EUR 48 397 and for the Company by EUR 28 283 as of 31 December 2022. If the weighting of the base case scenario was to increase to 100%, the expected credit loss allowance of the Group would decrease by EUR 40 331 and for the Company by EUR 23 569 as of 31 December 2022. Due to significant changes in underwriting policy of the Group, the historical structure of default due to debt sales before reaching 90 day delay has changed and the Management of the Group made significant judgement that the ECL coefficients calculated based on historical data should decrease by 16% for Banknote brand portfolio and by 24% for VIZIA brand portfolio. These judgments are supported by the decrease in NPL ratio from 4.8% as of 31 December 2020 to 1.9% as of 31 December 2021 to 1.4% as of 31 December 2022 and decrease in Stage 3 proportion from total unsecured loan portfolio from 5.3% as of 31 December 2020 to 2.8% as of 31 December 2021 to 1.7% as of 31 December 2022. The current adjustment is based on an expert judgement. If there was no adjustment for each brand portfolio, the expected credit loss allowance of the Group would increase by EUR 992 380 and for the Company by EUR 466 056 as of 31 December 2022 If the adjustment was to increase by 5 percentage points for each brand portfolio, the expected credit loss allowance of the Group would increase by EUR 255 307 and for the Company by EUR 143 505 as of 31 December 2022 The ECL model inputs and parameters were reviewed and where necessary updated. For more detailed qualitative and quantitative information on the impairment of financial assets, refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies section l Trade and other receivables and Note 15 Loans and receivables. ECL arising from trade receivables or contract assets is assessed as not significant due to the nature. SPPI for pawn loans The SPPI assessment for pawn loans is highly judgmental. The focus in determining whether SPPI criteria are met focused on the non-recourse aspect of the loans in combination with an relatively high risk of non-fulfillment of the loans and the pricing structure of the loans. In light of the returns from pawn loans in case of default being closely linked to the sale of collateral it was concluded that pawn loans do not meet SPPI criteria and therefore are required to be carried at fair value through profit or loss. The procedures for assessing and managing this risk are to some extent limited due to the collateral used to secure the loan. Fair value of pawn loans The measurement of fair value of pawn loans requires judgement in the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining the fair value of the performing pawn loans and the amount and timing of future cash flows when realizing collateral for non-performing loans. The elements for the fair value model for the performing loans are driven by the portfolio’s effective interest rate and portfolio’s free cash flows. The non-performing loan portfolio fair value calculations are dependent on the expected time of realization of the pledge, its market price, associated sales costs, and relevant discount rate. The fair value model inputs and parameters are periodically reviewed and where necessary updated. Net realisable value of inventories The cost of the Group’s inventory may have to be reduced to its net realisable value if the inventory has become damaged, is wholly or partly obsolete, or if its selling price has declined. The costs of inventory may not be recovered from sale because of increases in the costs to complete, or the estimated selling costs. Writing inventory down to net realisable value is carried out on an item-by-item basis. The Group’s estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available and take into account fluctuations of price or cost after the end of the period if this is evidence of conditions existing at the end of the period.

The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates. Leases are accounted based on contractual term, no significant judgment here. (u) Related parties Related parties include the shareholders, members of the Board and Supervisory Board of the Group, Supervisory Board their close family members and companies in which the said persons have control or significant influence. Term “Related parties” agrees to Commission Regulation (EC) 1126/2008 of 3 November 2018 which took in force various IAS according to European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 mentioned in Annex of IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”. (v) Subsequent events Post-period-end events that provide additional information about the Group’s position at the balance sheet date (adjusting events) are reflected in the financial statements. Post-period-end events that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes when material. (w) Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements. They are disclosed unless an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is possible. A contingent asset is not recognised in the financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. (x) Earnings per share Earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to the shareholders with the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. (y) Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker – the Group’s Board, which allocates resources to and assesses the performance of the operating segments of the Group. For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments based on products and services. Group’s segments are Pawn loan segment, Consumer loans segment, Retail segment and Other operating segment. Under Other operating segment there are accounted general Group administrative operations, services provided to related entities and real estates project development financing activities.

These systems are constantly built to meet both external and internal needs, and these are constantly being developed. As the systems are fully developed internally by IT department, related payroll and tax payments are capitalized for those IT employees who were involved in the development of the systems. The list of capitalized salaries is reviewed every month and capitalized amount is determined based on the works performed. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried a cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment During 2022 capitalised salary and related taxes for such systems amounted to EUR 348 685 (2021 EUR 251 795).

Under the programme a total of 450 000 new shares can be issued. In December 2022 employees were granted first stock options under the employee share option plan. According to the Company’s share option plan, share options of the parent are granted to all employees of the Company. The right to receive employee options belongs to those employees of the company who meet the following conditions: Employee has been with the company for at least 12 months; Employee has achieved the individual goals set for him by the Management and has contributed to achieving the common business goals. To exercise the share options the option holder has to be employed with the Group. Upon exercising their personnel options, option holders are entitled to receive the Company's newly issued shares for a fee. The price of one share of the Company's new issue is EUR 0.10 (10 cents). The minimum term of holding employee options from their allocation to the day the option holder is entitled to exercise the option rights is 12 months. The options have to be exercised within a month after their vesting date and there are no cash settlement alternatives. The Group recognized expenses in amount of EUR 93 058 during the reporting year (EUR 0 in 2021) in relation to the respective share option plan. The remaining 376 032 options of the plan whilst approved for use in future SBP schemes, have not been included in SBP contracts yet, hence no expense recognised in the year.

When estimating the fair value of options, the terms and conditions on which the share options were granted are considered, as well as making estimates on some of the assumptions to adjust for the BlackScholes model’s calculations. The inputs used in the model are market observable whenever possible including the share price, expected dividend yield and risk-free rate. The weighted average fair value of options granted at the measurement date was EUR 1.2581 (EUR 0 in 2021). The following table lists the key inputs used for calculating of fair value: Weighted average fair value of share price 1.468 Weighted average exercise price 0.10 Expected life of share options (years) 1 Expected volatility (%) 20% Dividend yield (%) 8% Risk-free interest rate (%) 3% (20) Bonds issued Group Group Company Company 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 EUR EUR EUR EUR Total long-term part of bonds issued 4 330 630 9 894 123 4 330 630 9 894 123 Bonds issued 14 758 261 931 039 14 758 261 931 039 Interest accrued 24 849 13 003 24 849 13 003 Total short-term part of bonds issued 14 783 110 944 042 14 783 110 944 042 Bonds issued, total 19 088 891 10 825 162 19 088 891 10 825 162 Interest accrued, total 24 849 13 003 24 849 13 003 Bonds issued net 19 113 740 10 838 165 19 113 740 10 838 165 As of 31 December 2022, the Parent company of the Group has outstanding bonds (ISIN LV0000850048) in the amount of EUR 5 000 000, registered with the Latvia Central Depository and issued in a closed offer on 9 July 2021 on the following terms: number of bonds issued 5 000, nominal value EUR 1 000 per each bond, coupon rate – 9.75%, coupon is paid once a month on the 25th date.

Retail of pre-owned goods Sale of pre-owned goods in the branches and online purchased from customers. Consumer loan segment Handling consumer loans to customers, debt collection activities and debt sales to external debt collection companies. Other operations segment Providing loans for real estate development, general administrative services to the companies of the Group, transactions with related parties. Loans for real estate development are no longer issued and are fully recovered. Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance, as explained in the table below, is measured on consolidation basis. Management mainly focuses on net sales, interest income and similar income and profit before taxes of the segment. For the costs, for which direct allocation to a particular segment is not attributable, the judgement of the management is used to allocate general costs by segments, based on the following cost allocation drivers – loan issuance, segment income, segment employee count, segment employee costs, the amount of segment assets. AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 56 / 61 Notes (continued) (28) Segment information(continued) Based on the nature of the services, the Group’s operations can be divided as follows: EUR Consumer loans Pawn loans Retail of pre-owned goods Other Total 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Assets 65 716 677 44 112 944 8 385 899 6 001 048 3 053 982 2 024 393 1 450 24 816 77 158 008 52 163 201 Liabilities of the segment 49 484 402 28 288 135 7 101 708 4 857 210 2 465 174 1 520 432 988 21 442 59 052 272 34 687 219 Net sales 6 472 567 4 821 871 6 472 567 4 821 871 Interest income and similar income 23 338 504 15 809 043 5 963 753 4 458 355 1 062 100 117 29 303 319 20 367 515 Net performance of the segment 9 269 254 7 012 668 1 931 082 1 330 343 698 270 389 633 28 440 91 600 11 927 046 8 824 244 Financial (expenses) (4 003 708) (3 197 395) (487 003) (408 733) (178 774) (133 061) (88 124) (4 669 485) (3 827 313) Profit/(loss) before taxes 5 265 546 3 815 273 1 444 079 921 610 519 496 256 572 28 440 3 476 7 257 561 4 996 931 Corporate income tax (939 970) (747 671) (258 314) (180 606) (92 745) (50 280) (5 079) (634) (1 296 108) (979 191) (29) Guarantees issued, pledges The Group has registered four groups of commercial pledges by pledging its assets and claim rights for a maximum amount of EUR 33 million as collateral registered to collateral agent SIA Eversheds Sutherland Bitāns (in favour of SIA Mintos Finance) and to SIA Mintos Finance No.20 and AS Mintos Marketplace to provide collateral for loans placed on the Mintos P2P platform. As of 31 December 2022, the amount of secured liabilities constitutes EUR 34 860 758 (As of 31 December 2021 EUR 18 573 636). (30) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: ► Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; ► Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and ► Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, comparison with similar instruments for which observable market prices exist, Black-Scholes and option pricing models. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, other premiums used in estimating discount rates, and expected price volatilities. The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. For more complex instruments, the Group uses proprietary valuation models, which are usually developed from recognised valuation models. Some or all of the significant inputs into these models may not be observable in the market, and may be derived from market prices or rates or estimated based on assumptions. Examples of instruments involving significant unobservable inputs include the valuation of pawn loan portfolio. Valuation models that employ significant unobservable inputs require a higher degree of management judgement and estimation in the determination of fair value. Management judgement and estimation are usually required for the selection of the appropriate valuation model to be used, determination of expected future cash flows on the financial instrument being valued and selection of appropriate discount rates. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Also set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s and the Group’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the Consolidated balance sheet. The table does not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.

Type of financial instrument Fair values at 31 December Valuation technique Significant unobservable input Range of estimates for unobservable input Fair value measurement sensitivity to unobservable inputs Pawn loans 2022: 6 322 368 (2021: 4 067 061) Discounted cash flow Sales costs Discount rate Expected return for cash-flows Sales margin cap 2022: 12% 32% (2021: 13.5%-35.5%) 2022: 6%-190% (2021: 6%-200%) 2022: (21%-34%) (2021: 29%-32%) 2022: (5%-85%) (2021: 5%-85%) Significant increases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in lower fair values. Significant unobservable inputs are developed as follows: Sales costs and sale margins are derived from historical trends. Expected cash flows are derived from the entity’s business plan and from historical comparison between plans and actual results. The effect of unobservable inputs on fair value measurement Although the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value. For fair value measurements in Level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have the following effects. Effect on profit or loss Favorable (Unfavorable) 31 December 2022 Pawn loans 563 382 (609 604) 31 December 2021 Pawn loans 322 678 (335 388) The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions for the valuation of pawn loans have been calculated by recalibrating the model values using unobservable inputs – sales costs, discount rate, expected return and sales margin cap. Key inputs and assumptions used in the models at 31 December 2022 included: the average monthly discount rate of 15.9% (with reasonably possible alternative assumptions of 14.9% and 16.9%) (2021: 16.8%, 15.8% and 17.8% respectively) cumulative average expected return of 32% (with reasonably possible alternative assumptions of 30% and 34%) (2021: 30.2%, 28.2% and 32.2% respectively) average sales margin cap of 85% (with reasonably possible alternative assumptions of 65% and 105%) (2021: 85%, 65% and 105% respectively) average sales costs of 22% (with reasonably possible alternative assumptions of 12% and 32%) (2021: 23.5%, 13.53% and 33.5% respectively) Collateral for pawn loans Pawn loans made by the Group are secured by collateral of the borrower limit the Group’s claim to cash flows of the underlying collateral (nonrecourse loans). The following table sets out the principal types of collateral held against pawn loans: 2022 2021 Goods 2 983 697 1 827 892 Gold 3 338 670 2 231 480 TOTAL 6 322 367 4 059 372 AS DelfinGroup Annual accounts and Consolidated annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 (translation from Latvian) 60 / 61 Notes (continued) (30) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities (continued) The following tables stratify credit exposures for pawn loans by ranges of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. LTV is calculated as the ratio of the gross amount of the loan to the value of the collateral. The valuation of the collateral excludes any adjustments for obtaining and selling the collateral. The value of the collateral for goods is determined on the collateral value at origination.

In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the separate and consolidated financial position of the Company and the Group, respectively, as at 31 December 2022, and of their separate and consolidated financial performance and their separate and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Basis for Opinion In accordance with the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia we conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing adopted in the Republic of Latvia (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) and independence requirements included in the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia that are relevant to our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Latvia. We have also fulfilled our other professional ethics responsibilities and objectivity requirements in accordance with the IESBA Code and the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Emphasis of Matter – comparative information We draw attention to Note 1 section Restatement in comparative figures due to correction of errors on page 21 of the separate and consolidated financial statements, which describes that the Company and the Group identified errors in the previous years relating to expected kpmg credit loss calculation, classification and resulting measurement error for pawn loans, application of effective interest rate method to interest income calculation, classification error for accounting of e-shop sales, as a result of which the comparative information presented as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021 and the statement of financial position as at 1 January 2021 have been restated. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matters described in the Emphasis of Matter section, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. kpmg Impairment allowances for Loans and receivables issued without pledge (separate and consolidated financial statements) Group’s consolidated financial statements The gross amount of Loans and receivables issued without pledge as at 31 December 2022: EUR 65 607 thousand (31 December 2021: EUR 43 234 thousand); impairment losses on Loans and receivables recognised in 2022: EUR 6 161 thousand (in 2021: EUR 2 815 thousand); total impairment allowance as at 31 December 2022: EUR 4 411 thousand (31 December 2021: EUR 3 546 thousand). Company’s separate financial statements The gross amount of Loans and receivables as at 31 December 2022: EUR 45 690 thousand (31 December 2021: EUR 32 626 thousand); impairment losses on Loans and receivables recognised in 2022: EUR 3 508 thousand (in 2021: EUR 1 566 thousand); total impairment allowance as at 31 December 2022: EUR 2 569 thousand (31 December 2021: EUR 2 365 thousand). We refer to the separate and consolidated financial statements: Note 1 (l) (Accounting policies), (s1.2) (Financial risk management), (t) (Significant assumptions and estimates), Note 15. Key audit matter How we addressed the key audit matter Loans and receivables issued without pledge, collectively represent approximately 79% of the Group’s assets as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: approximately 76%) and approximately 68% of the Company’s assets as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: approximately 67%). The Group offers loan products issued to private individuals. ln accordance with IFRS 9, the Company and the Group calculates impairment allowance based on expected credit losses ("ECLs"). ECLs are estimated mainly based on the historical pattern of losses and changes in loan risk characteristics based on qualitative and quantitative indicators such as the probability of default ("PD") and loss given default ("LGD"). The Company and the Group incorporates forward looking information into modelling techniques applied and recognizes a post model adjustment, where it is deemed appropriate. Impairment allowance represents the Management's best estimate of the expected credit losses related the Loans and receivables issued without pledge as at the reporting date and requires significant judgments. Our procedures in the area performed in coordination with our own financial risk modelling specialists included, among others: • inspecting the Group's expected credit loss ("ECL") methodology and assessing its compliance with the relevant requirements of IFRS 9; • testing selected key controls over the approval and recording and monitoring of loans; • assisted by our own information technology (IT) specialists, testing the application and general IT controls related to the ECL estimation process including calculation of days past due; • assessing the definition of default and the staging criteria and their consistent application by evaluating these against the requirements of IFRS 9; • independently assessing and challenging the forward-looking information used in the ECL model, by means of corroborating inquiries of the Management and inspection of publicly available information; kpmg Due to the above factors, we consider the area to be associated with a significant risk of material misstatement, which requires our increased attention in the audit. As such, we determined it to be a key audit matter. • challenging LGD and PD parameters, by assessing historical default Ievels and by reference to historical realized losses on defaults and loan sales; • assessing the adequacy of the Company’s and the Group’s disclosures on the loss allowances, credit risk management in the notes to the separate and consolidated financial statements. Fair value measurement of pawn loans (separate and consolidated financial statements) Company’s and Group’s consolidated financial statements The carrying amount of pawn loans as at 31 December 2022: EUR 6 322 thousand (31 December 2021: EUR 4 067 thousand). Income recognised from pawn loans in 2022: EUR 6 701 thousand (in 2021: EUR 5 074 thousand). We refer to the separate and consolidated financial statements: Note 1 (e) and (l) (Accounting policies), (t) (Significant assumptions and estimates), Note 15 and Note 30. Key audit matter How we addressed the key audit matter The Company and the Group have a significant balance of pawn loans. The Company and the Group measures pawn loans at fair value, with all changes therein recorded in profit or loss as a consequence of significant management judgment applied relating to these loans not meeting the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria set out in IFRS 9. The valuation of the Company’s and Group’s pawn loans measured at fair value involves significant judgements and estimates made by the management using the input from internal valuation of collaterals, particularly in relation to sensitivity of assumptions regarding selling costs of collateral, discount rates and cash flow projections. Due to the above factors, we consider the area to be associated with a significant risk of material misstatement, which requires our Our procedures included, among others: • involving IFRS accounting specialists in assessing the management judgment made in relation to assessment of compliance with solely payments of principal and interest criteria for pawn loans by inspecting the general terms and conditions applied to pawn loans, inspecting statistic relating to past outcomes for defaulted pawn loans in relation to realisation of collateral; • based on our understanding of the Company’s and Group’s approach to valuation of pawn loans, assessing the applied valuation methodology against the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; • using our own internal valuation specialists, challenging the valuation kpmg increased attention in the audit.

In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company, Group and their environment obtained in the course of our audit, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Other Reporting Responsibilities in Accordance with the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia Related to Other Information In addition, in accordance with the ‘Law on Audit Services‘ of the Republic of Latvia with respect to the Management Report, our responsibility is to consider whether the Management Report is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ‘Law on the Annual Reports and Consolidated Annual Reports’ of the Republic of Latvia. Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of our audit, in our opinion, in all material respects: — the information given in the Management Report for the financial year for which the separate and consolidated financial statements are prepared is consistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements; and — the Management Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ‘Law on the Annual Reports and Consolidated Annual Reports’ of the Republic of Latvia. In accordance with the ‘Law on Audit Services‘ of the Republic of Latvia with respect to the Statement of Corporate Governance, our responsibility is to consider whether the Statement of Corporate Governance includes the information required in section 56.1, first paragraph, clause 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9, as well as section 56.2, second paragraph, clause 5, and third paragraph of the ‘Financial Instruments Market Law‘ of the Republic of Latvia and if it includes the information stipulated in section 56.2 second paragraph, clause 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 of the ‘Financial Instruments Market Law‘ of the Republic of Latvia.

Furthermore, in accordance with the ‘Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia our responsibility is to consider whether the Remuneration Report includes the information kpmg required in section 59.4 of the ‘Financial Instruments Market Law‘ of the Republic of Latvia, and whether material misstatements have been identified in the Remuneration Report in relation to the financial information disclosed in the Annual Report. In our opinion, the Remuneration Report includes the information required in section 59.4 of the ‘Financial Instruments Market Law‘ of the Republic of Latvia, and no material misstatements have been identified in the Remuneration Report in relation to the financial information disclosed in the separate and consolidated Annual Report. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the separate and consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s and Group’s financial reporting process. Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s and Group’s internal control. — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. kpmg — Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s and Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and Group to cease to continue as a going concern. — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair presentation. — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Other Reporting Responsibilities and Confirmations Required by the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia and the European Union when Providing Audit Services to Public Interest Entities We were appointed by those charged with governance on 10 June 2022 to audit the separate and consolidated financial statements of DelfinGroup AS for the year ended 31 December 2022. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 1 year. We confirm that: — our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report presented to the Audit Committee of the Company and Group; — as referred to in the paragraph 37.6 of the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia we have not provided to the Company and Group the prohibited non-audit services (NASs) referred to of EU Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. We also remained independent of the audited entity and group in conducting the audit. kpmg For the period to which our statutory audit relates, we have not provided any services to the Company and Group in addition to the audit, which have not been disclosed in the Management Report or in the separate and consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group. The responsible certified auditor on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Rainers Vilāns. Report on the Auditors’ Examination of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) Report In addition to our audit of the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements, as included in the separate and consolidated Annual Report, we have also been engaged by the management of the Group to express an opinion on compliance of the separate and consolidated financial statements prepared in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting (“the ESEF Report”) with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 supplementing Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (the “RTS on ESEF”). Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the ESEF Report Management is responsible for the preparation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting that complies with the RTS on ESEF. This responsibility includes: — the preparation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in the applicable xHTML format; — the selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, using judgment where necessary; — ensuring consistency between digitised information and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and — the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the application of the RTS on ESEF. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process. Auditors’ Responsibility for the Examination of the ESEF Report Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the ESEF report complies, in all material respects, with the RTS on ESEF, based on the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about compliance with the RTS on ESEF. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements of set out in the RTS on ESEF, whether due to fraud or error. Our procedures included, among other things: kpmg — obtaining an understanding of the tagging process; — tracing the tagged data to the consolidated financial statements of the Group presented in human-readable format; — evaluating the completeness of the Group’s tagging of the consolidated financial statements; — evaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified; — evaluating the use of anchoring in relation to the extension elements; and — evaluating the appropriateness of the format of the separate and consolidated financial statements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the ESEF Report of the Company and Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022 has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the RTS on ESEF.
