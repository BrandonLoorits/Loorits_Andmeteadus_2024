Mickevičiaus st. 27, Kaunas, Lithuania CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 December 2022 (all amounts are in thousand EUR unless otherwise stated) 3 Statement of the Head of the Company Dear All, 2022 was a year of managed challenges for us – our ambitious targets at the start of the year were adjusted by the war in Ukraine and the resulting slowdown in travel demand, as well as the drastic rise in jet fuel prices, which led to a temporary loss. However, timely and targeted decisions helped to significantly improve our performance in the second half-year. We reacted promptly to changes in demand and adjusted our flight programme accordingly, while close cooperation with our partners helped us to confidently grow our sales and adapt our hotel offering. Last year, we took a strategic decision to implement the bookings of another tour operator (Kidy Tour) – a challenge which we managed successfully, not only meeting the expectations of the travellers themselves, but also significantly increasing the number of passengers served. The introduction of a fuel surcharge during the year helped to reduce loss due to fuel price volatility. After the first half-year, we recorded negative EBITDA (EUR -0.8 million) and a net loss (EUR -1.7 million); however, we closed the year with positive EBITDA (EUR +0,48 million). We returned to profitability already in the summer, and since September we have recorded a significant monthly revenue growth. Every month from the beginning of autumn until December has been more successful than the previous, and we ended the year with a record Group-wide revenue of EUR 197 million, compared to EUR 109 million in 2021. This achievement in a challenging period is above all the result of the team’s focus and professionalism, while the solid performance of the Group as a whole allows us to move forward with confidence. Targeted growth in customer numbers The number of our customers has been growing significantly. In 2022, Novaturas Group served 267k passengers, significantly closing the gap with the years 2018 and 2019, when the number of passengers was the highest ever. Comparing 2021 with 2022, the number of customers has increased by more than 55%. As we observe a targeted upward trend, we aim to continue to deliver a balanced travel programme, with a supply that organically matches demand and responds effectively to changes in the competitive environment. Leadership in the tourism market In October 2022, we launched early bookings for the summer season. We offered travellers a balanced and strategically well thought-out selection of destinations for 2023 and a benefits package that includes the lowest price guarantee. Early bookings for this summer exceeded last year’s figures for all destinations. As usual, we focused on destinations that are the most popular among travellers and are not losing their leading positions, such as Turkey and Greece In addition, we recorded a very strong growth in relatively new destinations which are being chosen by an increasing number of travellers – for example, sales to Montenegro and Tunisia exceeded last year’s presales by 3 times. Winter 2022 also witnessed a strong interest in exotic long haul destinations such as Thailand, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Seychelles, Cuba, Mexico, Zanzibar, Dominican Republic and others. Seeing the growing demand for such trips, we have increased our offering accordingly. We are also promising a greater focus on these destinations this year, so we plan to further expand the diversity of our range In fact, we are seeing a trend towards travellers planning their trips more and more in advance and choosing from a wider range of destinations, resorts, hotels and rooms. In comparison, the average time from purchase to start of travel was two months at the beginning of the year, while in the second half of the year it was approaching three months and continues to increase steadily. Achievements in aviation In 2022, we maintained a very high load factor across the Group, with a well-balanced supply of tourism products and a quick response to circumstances. On an annual average basis, it stood at 94.4%, and for the fourth quarter as a whole it exceeded 96%. In order to improve our customer experience and reduce our CO2 footprint, we replaced our aircraft in Estonia with a more environmentally friendly, next-generation “game-changer” Boeing 737-8 in December 2022. We see this as a key step in ensuring more sustainable travel. The new aircraft not only carries 5 per cent more passengers, but also consumes 12–15% less fuel. This translates into a 16–18% reduction in CO2 emissions, resulting in ~5,000–6,000 tonnes of CO2 less per year. Motivating staff and encouraging loyalty Another important step in 2022 to motivate our team of professionals and strengthen loyalty was that we were the first in the Lithuanian tourism market to introduce an option programme. All employees can participate by purchasing shares in the Company for less than the market price and thus contribute to the sustainable growth of the Company’s share value. We are applying the stock option programme in three areas: motivating top managers, giving all employees the opportunity to receive their incentive bonus in stock options instead of cash, and increasing the loyalty of employees depending on the period of service in the Company. Recognition for challenge management The success of Novaturas Group is reflected in a significant award. At the traditional Nasdaq Baltic Awards 2023, the Company was recognised as the company that did the best job overcoming recent challenges and managing market change. Novaturas won the title of “The Challenge of the Year” for its contribution to the development of Lithuanian and Baltic capital markets. NOVATURAS AB, Company code 135567698, A. Mickevičiaus st. 27, Kaunas, Lithuania CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 December 2022 (all amounts are in thousand EUR unless otherwise stated) 4 Summing up a challenging year that has helped us to return to sustainable growth in 2022, we look forward to the future with optimism and confidence. Even as the competitive environment intensifies, we are clearly maintaining our leadership as the largest tour operator in the Baltic tourism market and we are evidently increasing the gap with our closest competitors. This inspires us to continue to pursue ambitious goals and plan bold operational steps. Yours faithfully Vitalij Rakovski CEO NOVATURAS AB, Company code 135567698, A.

Mickevičiaus st. 27, Kaunas, Lithuania CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 December 2022 (all amounts are in thousand EUR unless otherwise stated) 11 Information about related party transactions Related party transactions are presented in the Explanatory Notes to the financial statements. Risk management The Group’s main business partners risk Pursuant to contracts with the key business partners, the Group is obliged to make advance payments for services ordered (e.g. charter airlines, coach companies or hotel operators). Thus, potentially not fulfilling or not properly fulfilling contractual obligations toward the Group and/or insolvency of the Group’s key business partners, including primarily toward charter airlines, may have a material adverse effect on the Group's operations, its financial condition and results of operations. In order to mitigate the risk Group diversifies partners and works with several aviation partners simultaneously also in big volume destinations works with several hotel providing partners. Credit risk The Group’s credit risk is relatively low as payment is requested before the tour. In addition, credit limits have been granted to travel agencies through which the majority of sales takes place. The main purpose of these credit limits is to ensure timely payments. If they exceeded the credit limit, the Company’s reservation system automatically blocks the sales. The Group does not provide guarantees for other parties’ liabilities. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, if any, in the statement of financial position. Therefore, in the opinion of the Company’s management, maximum risk is equal to the sum of trade debtors and other accounts receivable less impairment losses recognised in the Statement of Financial Position as of its date. Interest rate risk A larger part of the Group’s borrowings consists of loans subject to a fixed interest rate, whereas the Company’s credit line is related to the variable interest rate, the future use of which depends on future financial circumstances. In view of this, the Group does not use interest rate swaps and includes the relevant interest rate risk in the sales price of products. Foreign exchange risk The vast majority of the Group’s sales revenue is received in Euros, but part of the services that make up the cost, the most significant part of which is flights, are acquired in US dollars. To mitigate both aviation fuel volatility and aviation fuel related foreign exchange risk, as of 2014, the Group uses a hedging accounting treatment implemented via fuel futures (or options) and forward foreign exchange transactions, which ensure the margin hedge for travel products sold against fuel price and currency volatility. These derivatives are subject to hedge accounting. Liquidity management The Group pursues a policy of maintaining a sufficient amount of cash and cash equivalents or to secure financing by means of credit lines in order to fulfil its obligations under strategic plans. Liquidity risk is managed by planning the Group’s cash flows. As at 31 December 2022, the Group complied with all financial and non-financial covenants, under the financing agreements of the Group companies with banks and other credit providers. Capital management The main purpose of capital management is to ensure that the Group meets external capital requirements and maintains correct capital indicators so that the Group’s activities are sound and shareholder value is maximised (under IAS 1, “capital” corresponds to equity disclosed in financial statements). The Group manages the structure of its capital and changes it having regard to changes in the economic environment and operating risk. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders and issue new shares. In accordance with the Law on Companies of the Republic of Lithuania, the Company’s equity must account for at least 50% of its authorised capital, which consists of share capital and share premiums. The Company also complies with requirements regarding equity to asset ratio from the credit providers. As at 31 December 2022, the Company complied with these requirements. The Company assesses capital by means of the debt/equity ratio. The capital includes ordinary shares, reserves and retained earnings attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent company. Neither the Group nor the Company conduct any research and development. NOVATURAS AB, Company code 135567698, A.

Mickevičiaus st. 27, Kaunas, Lithuania ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 December 2022 (all amounts are in thousand EUR unless otherwise stated) 38 Encouraging feedback and employee engagement survey Seeking to ensure the best possible dialogue with employees, we are open to their feedback, and we explore different ways for them to share their feedback. Sharing feedback is part of our performance management and appraisal process: at the end of each quarter of the year we encourage managers to run quarterly performance review meetings with employees to discuss quarterly achievements, to review the relevance of the goals, to agree on activities/actions that will help to achieve the goals set. We also encourage our employees to give open feedback to their managers. Before the pandemic, we invited employees to participate in an Employee Engagement Survey to share their views and assess various organisational aspects: we analysed the results of the survey and developed action plans to address the identified issues. Although we had planned to conduct the survey every year, we took a break during the pandemic. The survey will be carried out in 2023 at the pan-group level and will assess five key factors for organisational engagement: trust in the organisation, concentration of leadership, meaningful work, empowering working environment, recognition and growth. The level of engagement will be measured by the main aspects of the organization: both by the structure of the company and by comparing the results among the individual companies in the Group. Objectives of the survey: • To identify the current level of employee engagement. • To assess the extent to which employees consider that the organisation is making good use of employee engagement opportunities. • To highlight the strengths and aspects of staff experience for improvement, which must be given priority in order to maintain and strengthen employee engagement. The overall findings of the survey will be discussed on an organisation-wide basis. The trends that emerged during the survey, the areas that need to be maintained and strengthened, will be discussed in individual teams. Action plans will be drafted to address the problems raised, and responsible persons have been appointed. Although the company-wide engagement survey was postponed to 2023, we conducted feedback surveys in teams, which helped to assess the aspects identified by the teams as important and critical to effective teamwork and employee satisfaction: leadership, access to information, cooperation, etc. We also introduced the teams to the results of such surveys asking them to suggest actions for change. Labour Council Novaturas has Labour Council from the end of November 2019, to ensure the most transparent representation of employees’ interests. Meetings of the Labour Council are held periodically to discuss the matters of concern to employees and submit them to the Company’s Board. The term of office of the elected Labour Council ended in November 2022. Upon the referral from the outgoing Labour Council, elections to the new Labour Council will take place at the beginning of 2023 in accordance with the procedure provided for in the Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania. Evaluation of performance In order to ensure the achievement of the Company’s objectives, managers hold regular quarterly performance review meetings with their employees. During one-to-one quarterly meetings, the manager and the employee discuss the achievement of the objectives agreed at the beginning of the year and actions aimed at achievement of objectives, assess the relevance of the objectives and, if necessary, review them. They also discuss and agree on the prerequisites or factors necessary for the successful achievement of goals: strengthening competency or certain skills, possible help from the manager or colleagues, etc., and they exchange feedback. We aim for the goals set for the employee to comply with the SMART model, that is, to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. During the annual performance review, the manager individually discusses with each employee of his/her team the performance throughout the year, summarises the achievements and agrees on a general assessment of the performance throughout the year.

In case of an insured event, the insurance company covers 80–100% expenses incurred by the employee for health care services provided (outpatient, inpatient or rehabilitation treatment), preventive health checks, vaccination, prescription drugs, and partially or fully covers various other medical services. Health insurance covers employees for a period of one year. Additional benefits.

Environmental Report On 9 November 2021, at the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow (COP26), United Nations launched an ambitious plan for the tourism industry to reach net zero by 2050. The new roadmap sets targets and benchmarks for the travel industry and offers practical recommendations for businesses on how they can achieve the set targets. For instance, hotels could bring in measures to improve energy efficiency, while new ones can be built using sustainable design practices. Airlines can improve existing aircraft technology by retrofitting and reducing weight, which increases fuel efficiency and lowers emissions. The cruise industry can reduce emissions by upgrading existing ships (through HVAC and lighting upgrades) and designing new ships to maximise energy efficiency. In response to the challenge of zero net emissions, the Group is continuously adapting its business to the expected developments in the industry. NOVATURAS AB, Company code 135567698, A. Mickevičiaus st. 27, Kaunas, Lithuania ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 December 2022 (all amounts are in thousand EUR unless otherwise stated) 40 Aviation: to reduce the carbon footprint and improve the customer experience, in Estonia, in December 2022, we replaced the 11-year-old AIRBUS A320 aircraft with a half-newer Boeing Max, which not only can carry 5% more passengers, but uses 12-15% less fuel to fly them. This change results in CO2 emissions savings of 16-18% (5-6 thousand tons) per year. One of the ways to reduce aviation-related carbon footprint the most (65-80%) is the use of sustainable aviation fuel produced from vegetal waste used in the aviation industry. And while the global production of this type of fuel is only accelerating (real competition for kerosene is projected to emerge around 2030), the Group is scanning the market for ways to offer our travellers more sustainable, less carbon-intensive journeys. Supply of sustainable travel products Travel-related emissions can be reduced not only by choosing more sustainable flights but also more sustainable travel options. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, hotels are accountable for one percent of global emissions. This number will continue to rise as hotel demand increases, which is why implementing sustainability initiatives in hotels is so important to mitigate this negative impact. Thus, environmentally conscious hotels pay special attention to waste management, the origin of the electricity and heat energy used, and energy efficiency. Novaturas collects this data and plans to add sustainable hotels to the options offered to travellers. This would allow to offer customers innovative and sustainable travel options (according to different studies, as many as 61% of travellers aim for more sustainable travel), and influence the decisions of hotel or hotel chain owners in an environmental compliance environment. In addition, AB Novaturas offered a new type of travel for environmentally conscious customers – sightseeing tours around Lithuania. During 2022, the Company offered more than 10 different options for sightseeing tours. Compared to international, local destinations are far more sustainable, with no aviation involvement and associated carbon footprint, at the same time, customers are given the opportunity to get to know their country better. In the future, the Company intends to expand such destinations, including geographical expansion across the Baltics. Taxonomy for sustainable activities The EU Taxonomy Regulation is not binding on Novaturas Group, however, the Company has decided to look at the requirements of the EU Taxonomy more closely. The Company’s core activity, organisation and sale of recreational and sightseeing tours by air, are beyond the scope of the EU Taxonomy. Only a small part of the Group’s activities, i.e. sightseeing tours by coach or water vehicles, and transfer from/to the airport to/from the hotel, are within the scope of the Regulation. Overall, all the activities covered by the EU Taxonomy represent less than 1% of the Group’s (and the Company’s) income, therefore, the EU Taxonomy compliance information is not provided in the financial statements due to its insignificance. However, the Group is preparing and in the future, with an expanded list of Taxonomy-eligible activities, will be ready to present the Group’s key sustainability performance indicators and their intended values.
