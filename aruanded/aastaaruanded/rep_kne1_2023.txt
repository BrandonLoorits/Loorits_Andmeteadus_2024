MATERIAL
 
TOPICS 
In 
2022 
Materiality 
assessment 
in 
KN 
was 
implemented: 
KN 
has 
analysed 
key 
sustainability 
topics 
to 
better 
respond 
to
 
stakeholder expectations, manage risks and act more sust
ainably. The initial list of topics 
was drawn up by the Company’s 
representatives and sustainability experts, assessing the Company's impacts and the key aspects affecting sustainability. 
Several 
remote 
meetings 
were 
held 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
–
 
representatives 
of 
Klaipėda

One 
of the 
most 
important KN's 
strategic 
objectives is 
to 
ensure the 
environmentally 
sustainable 
operation of 
KN ter
minals 
and 
full 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
requirements 
as 
with 
the 
new 
long
-term 
corporate 
strategy 
up 
to 
2050, 
KN 
aims 
at achieving com
plete climate neutrality for KN’s operations by 2050. 
 
 
Since 
2020, 
KN's 
environmental 
management 
system 
is 
certified 
with 
the 
ISO 
14001:2015 
standard 
and 
audited 
for 
its
 
compliance 
with 
the 
issued 
certificate 
(last 
audit 
in 
2022). 
Both 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
exist
ing 
Liquid 
and 
LNG 
terminals 
and 
the 
planning 
of 
new 
activities, 
KN 
complies 
with 
the 
basic 
principles 
of 
environmental 
protection 
set 
out in 
the Na
tional 
Environmental 
Strategy 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Lithuania, 
with 
the 
conditions 
set 
out 
in 
the 
environmental 
p
ermits, 
as 
well 
as 
with the norms set out in the environmental rules and standards. 
Also, KN has an approved “Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety Policy”, by which the Company commits:  
 
▪
 
 
To 
protect 
the 
environment, 
to 
use 
natural 
and 
energy 
resources 
rationally 
and 
sparingly, 
and 
to 
carry 
out 
effective 
prevention of pollution, waste generation, and unforeseen da
ngerous situations, and to strive for their reduction, 
▪
 
 
Plan and 
carry 
out our 
activities by 
assessing 
possible risks, 
implementing, 
and using 
environmentally 
friendly and 
advanced technologies and work methods. 
Furthermore, the 
Company has 
a 
procedure for 
determining environmental 
protection 
aspects and 
environmental impact 
management, the purpose of which is 
to determine and ensure the identification of environmental protection aspects, the 
determination 
of 
their 
significance 
and 
 
impact 
on 
the 
environment, 
and 
their 
management 
to 
ensure 
the 
efficiency 
of 
environmental prote
ction and comp
liance with 
applicable legal 
acts and 
the requirements 
of the 
ISO 14001:2015 
standard.
 
Following this procedure, KN has 
identified the significant environmental aspects of 
its operations and their impact on 
the
 
environment and designed the necessary control 
and management measures to avoid 
negative environmental impacts o
f 
our activities and mitigate them. 
KN’s 
environmental 
management

and 
 
efficient 
 
use 
 
of 
 
other 
 
natural 
 
resources. 
 
Th
e 
 
Company 
continuously  monitors  its 
 
impact  on  environmental  quality 
 
via  the  following  ind
icators:
  greenhouse 
 
gas  emissions, 
emissions 
of

IMPACT
 
REDUCTION
 
We acknowledge our responsibility for our environmental footprint 
and search for ways to minimise it rather than 
comply 
with 
 
environmental 
 
norms 
 
and 
 
requirements. 
 
Based 
 
on 
 
ISO 
 
st
andard 
 
140001:2005 
 
KN 
 
has 
 
Environmental 
 
Protection
 
Program 
which 
is 
active 
from 
2022. 
The 
Program 
in
cludes 
specific 
quantitative 
mitigation 
targets 
for 
2024 
and 
2030 
and 
corresponding measures. 
The main goals that were identified and tracked in the scope of the Program: 
▪
 
 
To reduce 
direct CO2 
emissions of 
Klaipėda Liquid 
Energy 
terminal (Scope 
1) by at 
least 2
0% by the 
end of 
2024 
and at least 50% by the end of 2030, compared to 2020.   
▪
 
 
Use only 
green electricity 
to reduce 
indirect CO2 
emissions (Scope 
2) generated 
while producing 
electricity used 
in Klaipėda and Subačius Liquid 
Energy Terminals. 
▪
 
 
To reduce natural gas and electricity consumption by at least 3% by the end of 2024 and at least 10% by the end 
of 2030, compared to 2020.   
▪
 
 
To reduce 
relative (e
missions/transshipped products) 
VOC emissions 
from the 
handling 
and storage 
of petrole
um
 
products 
by 
35% 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2024 
and 
by 
45% 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2030, 
compared 
to 
2020, 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
maximum 
odour 
concentration 
in 
ambient 
air 
(caused 
by 
relevant 
air 
emissions) 
will 
not 
exceed 
1 
odour 
unit 
in 
the residential environment d
ue to the 
activity of 
KLET by 
the end of 2024,
 and will not 
exceed 0
.7 odour unit 
till 
the end of 2030. 
▪
 
 
To increase the% of waste recycled 
–
 to 
reach at least 70% by the end of 2024 and 
at least 90% of waste recycled 
by the end of 2030. 
In 
 
2023 
 
a 
 
new 
 
long-
term 
 
corporate 
 
strategy 
 
up 
 
to 
 
2050 
 
with 
 
goal 
 
of 
 
achieving 
 
complete 
 
climate 
 
neutrality 
 
for 
 
KN’s 
operations 
by 
2050 
was 
 
prepared 
 
and 
 
approved. 
It 
sets 
goals 
of 
 
reducing 
 
emissions 
 
by 
over 
30 
precent 
 
by 
 
2030 
and 
approximately 
70 
percent 
by 2040. 
It re
quires 
a 
very 
clear 
focus 
on 
reduction 
of 
emissions 
into 
the 
atmosphere 
and 
increase 
of energy efficiency using energy resources. Accordingly, KN sets the following short-term goals (2023-2030): 
▪
 
 
100% use of green electricity (KN) while producing electricity for own use in KLET and SLET. 
▪
 
 
30% reduction in VOC emissions vs 2022. 
▪
 
 
>90% waste recycled. 
Considering the 
significant update 
of the 
KN 
strategy, the 
internal emission 
management plan 
is planned 
to 
be reviewed, 
aligned and updated in 2024 to reflect agreed c
hanges and ambitions set in the KN strategy and progress of achievement 
of goals will be reported accordingly in the annual Sustainability report for 2024.   
We 
constantly 
seek 
new 
technical 
solutions 
to 
reduce 
emissions 
and 
waste 
and 
mitigate 
our 
impact. 
For 
example, 
since 
2018, 
KN 
has 
been 
implementing 
the 
Environmental 
Action 
Plan 
in 
response 
to 
comments 
from 
communities 
regarding 
perceived 
unpleasant 
odours. 
It 
aims 
to 
reduce 
volatile 
organic 
compound 
(VOC) 
emissions 
via 
more 
efficient 
neutralisation 
of VOCs. Communities and 
other interested parties are constantly informed 
about the progress of implementing this 
plan.
 
KN investments related to the implementation of this plan have reached EUR 8 million.  
Other 
significant 
investments 
related 
to 
reducing 
our 
negative 
environmental 
impact 
are 
mentioned 
in 
relevant

As 
 
in 
 
other 
 
companies, 
 
teleworking 
 
has 
 
become 
 
commonplace 
 
during 
 
t
he 
 
pandemic 
 
and 
 
has 
 
taken 
 
hold 
 
among 
 
the 
Company's 
employees, 
who 
are 
increasingly 
turning 
to 
hybrid 
working 
options 
that 
is 
becoming 
a 
regular 
practice. 
This 
way, 
more 
meetings 
between 
diff
erent 
departments 
are 
being 
held 
by 
vid
eoconferencing, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
long-distance journeys and, consequently, contributing positively to the environmental impact.  
In 
addition, much 
of 
the administrative 
work 
was digitalised 
(use 
of e-signature 
for signing 
contracts 
and other 
documents, 
etc.) 
and 
is 
still
 
being

The 
Company 
also 
has 
a

EMISSIONS 
The 
Company 
prepares 
annual 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emission 
reports 
following 
the 
European 
Union 
Emissions 
Trading 
Scheme requir
ements and 
annual 
GHG 
reports 
following 
the 
requirements 
of 
The 
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Protocol: 
A 
Corporate 
Accounting 
 
and 
 
Reporting 
 
Standard 
 
(from 
 
now 
 
on 
 
–
 
 
GHG 
 
Protocol). 
 
As 
 
GHG 
 
emissions 
 
directly 
 
con
tribute 
 
to 
 
climate 
change, we are constantly searching for ways to reduce our emissions 
–
 starting with Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  
GHGs in KN’s a
ccounting include CO2 and CH4 emi
ssions.
 Emissions of other 
greenhouse gases (N
2
O, HFCs, PFCs, SF
6
) are 
not accounted for because no significant sources of pollution with these gases have been identified.  
GHG emissions we already account for: 
▪
 
 
Scope 
1. 
Direct 
CO2 
emissions 
(from 
boilers 
and 
vehicles) 
and 
direct 
CH4 
emissions 
(from 
gas 
leaks 
in 
pipelines 
and tanks). Since 2022 we also include emissions from refrigeration reagents. 
▪
 
 
Scope 
2. 
Indirect 
CO2 
emissions 
related 
to 
the 
production 
of 
purchased 
electricity. 
Since 
2022 
we 
also 
include 
heat energy consumed in KN's leased office premises. 
▪
 
 
Scope 
 
3. 
 
Indirect 
CO2 
 
emissions 
 
from 
the 
 
production 
 
of 
purchased 
materials, 
 
the 
paper 
 
used, 
 
and 
emissions 
related to wa
ter supply, sewage, waste 
management and some services. Since 
2022 electrical transmission losses, 
some 
business 
travel-related 
data 
(flights, 
accommodation) 
and 
losses 
related 
to 
liquid 
energy 
product 
logistics
 
were also added into calculations.  
Currently, 
94% 
of KN’s 
GH
G 
emissions 
are 
treated 
as Scope 
3 
emissions 
because 
FSRU Indepe
ndence is 
owned 
by 
company 
Hoegh 
LNG 
and 
thus 
included 
in 
Scope 
3: 
the 
most 
significant 
share 
of 
these 
GHG 
emissions 
being 
CO2 
emissions 
from 
the 
 
used 
 
natural 
 
gas 
 
and 
 
diesel 
 
on 
 
vessels,
 
 
us
ed 
 
for 
 
transportation 
 
of 
 
LNG 
 
vessels. 
 
When 
 
KN 
 
takes 
 
over 
 
the 
 
FSRU 
Independence in 
202
4, emissions of the LNG terminal will be accounted as Scope 1 emissions. 
According 
to 
t
he 
Reporting 
G
uidelines, 
it 
is 
not 
recommended 
to 
include 
information 
about 
the 
electricity 
produced 
for 
your 
own 
needs 
in 
the 
calculations 
if 
it 
is 
produced 
from 
natural 
gas 
to 
avoid 
double 
account
ing. 
Therefore, 
emissions
 
related to 
electricity produced 
by LNG Terminal 
for its 
own needs from 
liquefied natural 
gas are 
not included in 
any Scope. 
Additionally, they are already included in Scope 3 as emissions from used natural gas and diesel in LNG Terminal.

not release in
to the environment 
1,781
 
of CO2 emissions. 
*** 95% of KN’s GHG emissions (Scope1) con
sist of emissions from combustion
 plants using fossil fuels
 
 
The Scope 1 
emissions decreased 
in

8%. 
In 2023, 8% 
less natural gas 
was used in 
Klaip

due 
to 
the 
more

and 
65% 
less 
liquid 
fuel 
in

ius 
Liquid Energy terminal 
due to the usage of self-ge
nerated and saved green electricity for

s
. Increase in 
Scope 
3 
emissions 
is 
influenced 
by 
the

terminal 
operations
. 
The 
one 
time 
increase 
in 
Scope

emissions 
 
was 
recorded 
due 
 
to 
 
the

is 
around 
3,000 square 
metres.
 
The electricity 
produced 
by 
the 
plant will 
meet 
100% 
of the electricity demand o
f Subačius Liquid

In 2023, 
24 heat 
pumps 
(air-

of 
 
192 
 
kW, 
 
while 
 
the 
 
12 
 
air-

heat 
 
pumps 
 
have 
 
a 
combined 
total 
capacity 
of

40
 
kW. 
Heat 
pumps 
will 
use 
renewable 
energy 
 
from 
 
the 
 
solar

The 
value 
of 
investment 
in 
this 
project 
is 
around 
EUR 
147
 
thousand (the project is 100% financed by EMPA funds).  
Klaipėda Liquid 
Ener
gy Terminal has installed 
a solar collector system 
for a hot 
water system with 
a total surface 
area of 20 
m
2
. 
 
The 
 
system 
 
will 
 
heat

The 
 
value 
 
of

project 
 
is 
 
EUR 
 
141 
thousand 
(the 
project 
is 
partially 
financed 
by 
EMPA 
funds). 
It 
is 
preliminary 
estimated 
that 
the 
implemented 
solutions 
might 
reduce KN CO2 emissions by at least 130 t per year. Actual data will be tracked and reported annually. 
The Company also plans 
to continue 
investing in sustainable ways 
of generating 
electricity. A project of 
solar power plant
 
with 
a 
capacity 
of

to 
be 
installed 
at 
the 
KN 
Liquid

in
 
Klaipėda 
is 
also 
estimated. 
 
This 
 
would 
 
require 
 
an

of 
 
around 
 
EUR 
 
700

is 
planned 
to 
be 
i
mplemented 
in 
2025 
(Q2). 
Technical 
assessment 
of 
existing 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
Klaipėda

to 
identify 
the 
most

was 
caried 
out
 
by 
international 
consortium 
of 
technical 
engineering 
companies 
in 
2023. 
The 
most 
suitable 
option 
was 
sel
ected; 
however, 
it
 
needs 
separate design 
works 
and additional 
equipment 
procurement as 
well 
as its 
integration 
into automatic 
management 
system 
 
of

procedures 
 
are 
 
planned 
 
and 
 
may 
 
take 
 
up 
 
to 
 
1 
 
year. 
 
C
onsequently, 
 
the 
implementation 
term 
for 
this 
measure 
was 
postponed 
to 
year 
2025. 
After 
implementation 
it 
will 
allow 
the 
reduction 
of 
emissions of VOCs as well as the intensity of odours in the residential environment.

WATER
 
AND
 
SEWAGE 
WATER AND SEWAGE RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF LIQUID ENERGY TERMINALS 
The primary 
water source 
used in 
the operations 
of 
Klaipėda Liquid 
Energy 
Terminal is 
centralised w
ater supply 
networks. 
In 2023, 
54% of 
water from c
entralised networks 
was used for 
steam production 
and on 
the 
l
iquid energy 
product trestle. 
34% of the water was spilt due to a broken pipe; the rest was used for household purposes and provided to subscribers.  
Subačius 
Liquid 
Energy 
Terminal 
draws 
water 
from 
a 
groundwater 
well 
for 
economic 
activities. 
Since 
April 
2022, 
surface 
water has been used for firefighting purposes and thus accounted for. 
Water 
consumption by 
Klaipėda and 
Subačius Liquid 
Energy Terminals 
does not 
significantly impa
ct water 
sources, despite 
that 
KN 
still 
applies 
measu
res 
to 
reduce 
water 
consumption. 
After 
optimizing 
the 
liquid 
energy 
products 
handling 
and 
storage 
processes 
in 
2022, 
KLET's 
boiler 
hous
e 
used 
35% 
less 
water 
for 
steam 
production 
in 
2023 
than 
in 
2022.

To 
meet 
all 
envi
ronmental 
protection 
requirements 
and 
established 
standards, 
KN 
collects 
and 
treats 
the 
sewage 
generated 
in operation. 
The number of 
pollutants discharged with 
sewage is calculated followi
ng the methodologies approved 
in the 
Republic of Lithuania. The installed accounting devices account for the amount of sewage released.  
Klaipėda 
Liquid 
Energy 
Terminal 
operates 
a 
unique 
sewage 
treatment 
system. 
Wastewate
r 
generated 
by 
the 
Company's 
economic activities 
(industrial 
–
 including bi
lg
e water 
from ships, domestic, and
 surface sewage) is 
collected and treated 
in 
biological 
sewage 
 
treatment 
 
plants 
 
based 
 
o
n 
 
biosorption 
 
processes 
 
(with 
 
activated 
 
carbon 
 
and 
 
microorganisms). 
 
This 
system 
installed 
by 
 
KN 
 
is 
 
a 
 
unique 
technology 
 
designed 
 
by 
 
the 
 
Company 
 
that 
 
allows 
for 
achieving 
an 
extremely 
high 
sewage 
treatment efficiency 
(80
-99%, dependi
ng 
on the 
indicator). 
The Company’s 
sewage treatment 
plant is 
also used 
for 
collecting and 
treating sewage 
related to 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
State 
Seaport 
of 
Klaipėda 
–
 
such 
as 
vessel-generated 
waste 
(bilge water) and cargo residues. 
The treated sewage is discharged into the Curonian Lagoon (via 
the Klaipėda port channel) only after laboratory control is 
conducted and meeting the required standards is confirmed. Monitoring of
 discharged sewage and the impact on surface 
water 
quality 
is 
performed 
–
 
part 
of 
it is 
monitoring 
the 
condition 
of the 
Curonian 
Lagoon 
(Klaipėda 
Strait) 
below 
and 
above 
the sewage discharge facility. The monitoring data is provided monthly on the KN website (in the Lithuanian language).  
Subačius 
 
Liquid 
 
Energy 
 
Terminal 
 
operates 
 
a 
 
sewage 
 
treatment 
 
plant, 
 
which 
 
treats 
 
surface 
 
sewage 
 
collected 
 
from 
 
the 
terminal territory and 
domestic sewage. Sewage is treated up to 
the standards and discharged 
into a surface water body 
–
 
the 
Lėvuo 
River. 
The 
company 
itself 
carries 
out 
the 
monitoring 
of 
SL
ET 
discharged 
effluents 
once 
a 
quarter, 
periodical

WATER AND SEWAGE RELATED TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE LNG TERMINAL 
The 
only 
water 
source 
used 
in 
the 
LNG 
storage 
vessel 
is 
the 
Curonian 
Lagoon 
–
 
accounted 
as 
surface 
water. 
The 
related 
infrastructure does not use Centralised water and uses just a small amount (less than 100 m3 per year) of groundwater. 
Water 
in 
the 
vessel 
is 
used 
for 
these 
technological 
processes: 
(i) 
cooling 
of 
the 
ship's 
engines 
and 
auxiliary 
equip
ment 
premises; (ii) 
in the gasification unit 
water is used 
in the LNG "defrosting" 
process; (iii) 
for "water curtain", which 
means
 the 
continuous spraying 
of water on the 
hulls during the 
transshipment of LNG from/
to the LNG carrier/storage 
vessel, so that 
in the 
event of LNG leakag
e damage to the 
hull is prevented. 
In 2023, about 
72.24
% of the 
extracted water wa
s used in the
 
gasification plant, about 27.16% was used in cooling and 0.6% for "water curtain".

Water 
used 
in

is 
not

–
 
it
 
meets 
the 
established

parameters 
and 
does

therefore, 
it 
does

WASTE
 
MANAGEMENT
 
Following 
ISO 
14001:2015, 
the 
Company 
has 
a 
Waste 
Management 
Procedure 
–
 
it 
determines 
the 
waste 
management 
process, 
including 
the 
accounting 
procedure 
of 
waste 
generated 
and 
man
aged 
(transferred 
to 
waste 
handlers). 
Waste 
is 
managed 
following 
environmental 
requirements 
to 
avoid 
negative 
effect
s 
on 
the 
health 
of 
KN 
employees, 
the 
general 
public and the e
nvironment. A dedicated department is 
created to manage waste-related processes, and 
internal audits of 
the 
waste 
management 
system 
are 
carried 
out 
regularly 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Waste 
Management 
procedure. 
This 
department 
also 
manages 
a 
dedicated 
intranet 
page, 
where 
employees 
can 
find 
all 
relevant 
information 
related 
to
 
waste 
–
 
it 
is 
helpful 
for 
employees 
at 
work 
and 
in 
their 
daily 
activities. 
Additional 
internal 
waste 
prevention 
and 
recycling 
training is conducted for the Company's employees. 
The 
most 
significant 
amount 
of 
waste 
in 
KN 
is 
g
enerated 
during 
the 
op
erations 
of 
the 
terminals 
 
–
 
loading 
operations, 
technical 
maintenance, 
tank 
cleaning, 
and 
waste 
management. 
The 
largest 
part 
of 
hazardous
 
waste 
co
nsists 
of 
various 
materials 
and 
 
water 
 
which 
had 
 
contact 
 
with 
 
oil 
products. 
 
Most 
 
non-hazardous 
 
waste 
 
is 
mixed 
 
municipal, 
 
scrap 
 
metal, 
bitumen,  and  large/mixed  construction  waste.  Information  on  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  waste  generated  and 
managed is 
presented separately, 
based on information 
provided by waste 
handlers, according to 
the Waste 
Management 
Rules of the Republic of Lithuania. 
We 
aim 
to 
increase 
the% 
of 
KN 
waste 
recycled 
–
 
to 
reach 
at 
least 
90% 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2030. 
For 
that 
purpose, 
w
hen 
concluding
 
contracts with 
licensed waste 
handlers, we 
ask them to 
ensure that 
priority will 
be given 
to waste re
cycling and that 
no less 
than 90% of the amount transferred per year will be recycled. In 2023 the amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste

that

▪
 
 
to reduce the p
ercentage of the pay gap between fem
ale and male positions 
at the same H

percentage 
per 
year 
(and 
to increase 
propor
tion 
of 
women in managing roles to > 36% 
by
 
2030
).
 
Indicators 
showing 
the 
achievement 
of 
the
se
 objecti
v
es 
and 
the 
extent 
of 
the measures 
taken are 
describe
d 
in 
detail 
further 
in this report. 
We 
aim to 
create 
a motivating 
working 
environment. Achieving 
long-term success 
requires 
diverse ideas, 
perspectives, and 
talents. Therefore, at 
KN, we support diversity: a 
key source of innovation and comp
etitiven
ess, allowing each 
of us to fully 
participa
te and 
contribute 
to the 
Company’s 
success and 
help 
to 
ensure that 
business 
operates 
efficiently and 
reaches 
its 
potential. 
KN’s 
reward 
and 
incentive 
principles 
are 
based 
on 
its 
employees' 
qualifications, 
experience, 
competencies, 
and 
performance, thus avoiding bias or personal preferences.  
We 
are 
guided 
by 
the 
values 
of 
KN 
and 
adhere 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
respect, 
cooperation, 
professionalism, 
and 
progress. 
Our 
values 
guide 
how 
we 
operate 
anywhere 
in 
the 
world 
and 
what 
w
e 
expect 
from 
ourselves, 
our 
colleagues, 
our 
clie
nts, 
our 
management, 
and 
other 
key 
stakeholder 
s. 
Our 
quarterly 
and 
annual 
recognition 
initiatives 
are 
based 
on 
values, 
not 
only 
achievements. 
In 
2023 KN 
initiated 
values review 
process in 
the Organisation. 
Th
e 
main 
aim 
of 
the 
renewal is 
to update 
Company’s values 
to reflect 
chan
ged busine
ss environment 
and newly 
adopted KN 
strategy 
until 2050 
as the 
values 
were 
identified 
and 
agreed 
in 2018. 
The 
following 
actions 
were 
taken: In 
September 
–
 
October 
20
23 
discussions 
regarding 
values 
took place in KN’s de
partment level, i.e., manage
rs discussed in their depa
rtments what we are doing well, what should 
be 
improved  and  what  should  be  continued  and  selected  one  re
presentative  from  each  department.  On  October  25 
departments’ 
representatives 
participated 
in 
the 
dedicated 
event 
where 
values
 
and 
how 
they 
should 
be 
changed 
were 
discussed. About 100 employees participated in this event. As a re
sult, 10 statements were identified which were reviewed 
in a 
half-day sess
ion with 
the directors 
of the 
Company. 
The project is 
continued 
and planned 
to 
be 
finished in 
2024 
with 
the values material being prepared and presented to employees of KN.  
KN 
 
activities  are 
 
also  guided 
 
by  the 
 
principles  of 
 
human  rights 
protection 
and 
ensuring 
that 
the 
Company 
does 
not 
contribute 
to
 
any 
human 
rights 
infringements. 
We 
foster 
an 
environment 
where 
employees are treated 
equally, respected, 
and empowered to 
reach 
their 
potential. We 
ensure 
that the 
Company is 
free 
from all 
forms of 
discrimination 
 
–
 
 
gender, 
 
r
eligion, 
 
age, 
 
disability, 
 
race, 
 
sexual 
orientation, etc.  
The 
Company 
is 
committed 
to 
a 
fair, 
competitive, 
and 
transparent 
remun
eration 
policy, 
complies 
with 
laws 
on 
overtime 
work and 
working time, re
spec
ts the 
right of workers 
to rest and 
does not 
t
olerate any 
form of 
harassment or violence. 
We 
oppose all forms of discrimination and
 forced labour. As set out in the 
Cod
e of Conduct of KN, 
which applies to KN Group 
as a whole, 
the Company's 
employees, irrespective of 
gender, nationality, 
religion, social or 
marital status, 
membership of 
a 
social 
or 
political 
organisation, 
or 
any 
other 
personal 
characteristic, 
have 
equal 
opportunities 
to 
hold 
managerial 
positions, 
to take part in decision-making, and to develop their professional skills. 
In 
2023, 
the 
same 
as 
in 
the 
previous 
year, 
the 
Company 
did 
not 
register 
any 
cases 
of 
human 
rights 
violations 
or 
related 
complaints. We 
will 
continue to 
strive 
to 
ensure the 
highest 
standards of 
human 
rights 
protection in 
KN 
and to 
secure 
an 
organisational culture 
fostering 
human 
rights. Furthermore, 
we educate 
our 
staff 
periodically 
on H

issues 
and 
want 
to 
reach 
the 
goal 
of 
every

The 
Company 
is 
committed 
to 
providing 
equal 
opportunities 
for 
all 
employees, 
regardless 
of 
gender, 
age, 
etc. 
Nevertheless, 
most 
of 
the 
Company's 
employees 
(73,8%) 
still 
are 
male. 
Male 
to 
female 
workers 
ratio 
was 
2.86 
in 
Lithuania 
(the 
m
ost 
considerable dis
proportion a
mong workers) 
and 
5.75 
in 
Brazil. 
The 
ratio 
is 
mainly 
influenced by 
the 
specific 
nature 
of 
the 
Company's business, 
i.e. women 
are still 
less likely to 
opt for technical 
engineering and 
field
-based technological 
work and 
the specialities 
direct
ly related 
to 
these 
activities. 
To 
address 
this 
challenge, 
the Company 
has 
set 
the 
gender 
balance 
KPI 
for 
the 
managerial 
rol
es 
and 
seeks 
gender 
balance 
in 
the 
communication 
about 
the 
successful 
career 
p
ath 
of 
employees
 
within the organisation.  
In 
 
2023, 
 
2
6.3% 
 
of 
 
managerial 
 
positions 
 
(including 
 
members 
 
of 
 
th
e 
collegial 
 
bodies, 
 
15 
 
women 
 
in 
 
total) 
 
in 
 
K
N 
 
in 
 
Lithuania 
 
were 
 
held 
 
by
 
women (in 2022 - 26.78%, in 2021 
–
 26.6%, in 2020 
–
 24.56%).  
The 
 
revised 
 
KN 
 
strategy 
 
2050 
 
includes 
 
th
e 
 
target 
 
for 
 
gender 
 
balance 
assurance 
 
in 
 
managerial 
 
positions 
 
(> 
 
36% 
 
proportion 
 
occupied 
 
by 
women). The goal to increase proportion of 
women in managing roles to 
> 36% 
is set already for 2030. Th
e goal for 2024 
is 
to 
have 
30% 
or 
more 
women 
in 
managerial 
positions 
to 
ensure 
gender 
 
balance. 
To 
reach 
this,

The net

KN Lithuania was 3 
(
9 
men compared to 
3 women; and 1.7 
if excluding changes 
due 
to 
the 
end 
of 
temporary

This

similar

2.7. The

(data

. 
Gender

of 
4.1 
(2.07

The increased supply 
of relevant 
job positions 
in the labour 
market has infl
uenced staff turnover 
in Brazil. Th
e turnover of 
employees 
in 
Lithuania 
was 
affected 
by 
the 
voluntary 
decision 
of 
employees 
to 
continue 
their 
career 
path 
beyond 
the 
organisation. Further optimisation 
of processes to 
increase efficiency has 
also contributed to 
increased staff turnover.

COLLECTIVE
 
BARGAINING
 
AGREE
MENT 
The provisions of 
the Collective 
Agreement of 
the KN 
apply to all 
KN employees 
in Lithuania 
–
 permanent 
and temporary 
ones. 
 
The 
 
agreement 
 
aims 
 
to 
 
create 
 
conditions 
 
for 
 
sustainable 
 
economic 
 
activity 
 
and 
 
business 
 
development 
 
and 
 
to 
guarantee 
better 
working 
c
onditions 
than those 
provided 
for 
in 
the legislation 
of 
the 
Republic of 
Lithuania. 
It 
covers wages, 
working and rest time, training, health and safety, other socio-economic working conditions, and additional benefits.  
In 2023, 
38 
workers in 
Lithuania benefited 
from 
the relevant 
social gu
arantees under 
the c
ollective bargaining 
agreement 
of 
KN, 
such 
as 
childbirth 
benefits 
or 
 
payments 
 
in 
 
the 
event 
of 
the 
death 
of 
a 
relative 
(61 
workers 
benefited 
from 
the 
collective agreement in 2022, 46 in 2021). 
The 
 
Collective 
 
bargaining 
 
agreement 
 
is 
 
in 
 
place 
 
in 
 
KN 
 
Aç
u 
 
in 
 
Brazil 
 
since 
 
2021. 
 
It 
 
aims 
 
to 
 
guarantee 
 
better 
 
working 
conditions than thos
e provided for 
in the 
legislation of 
the Republic 
of Brazil. 
It covers 
issues su
ch as wages, 
working and 
rest 
time, 
training, 
health 
and 
safety, 
and 
other 
socio-economic 
working 
conditions 
and 
additional 
benefits. 
In 
2023, 
26 
workers 
in 
Brazil 
b
enefited 
from 
the 
relevant 
social 
guarantees 
under 
the 
collective 
bargaining 
agreement 
of 
KN 
Açu 
(2
6 
workers benefited from the collective agreement in 2022, 27 in 2021). 
According 
to the current 
KN Group 
practice, workers 
can lodge comp
laints about working 
conditions and 
infringements of 
their rights with the 
respective trade union directly to the 
H
R unit or anonymously by 
filling in a form on the we
bsite or by 
email, or 
through suggestion boxes in 
the Company's Terminals 
(in Lithuania). However, 
no such complaints were
 received 
in 2023. 
LABOUR

Group 
recognises 
the 
labour 
union 
as

Accordingly,

is 
one 
of 
our 
ESG 
goals. 
The 
average 
monthly 
remuneration 
for 
men 
in 
K
N

in 
2023
 
was 
EUR 
3,104

and 
for 
women 
–
 
EUR 
3,147

comparing 
 
average 
 
monthly

the 
 
unequal 
gender 
distribution 
between

KN 
has 
set 
a 
target 
to 
reduce 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
pay 
gap 
between 
female 
and

positions 
at 
the

DEVELOPMENT
 
OF
 
COMPETENCES 
The 
KN 
education 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
employees 
both 
independently 
and 
through 
the 
learning 
processes 
of 
strategically

that 
are 
part 
of 
the 
cur
ricula. 
Therefore, 
all 
employees 
are given the opportunity to participate in the programs. 
Implementing the KN education system is based on 6 
principles: 
link 
with 
 
business 
 
strategy, 
 
cooperation 
between 
 
departments, 
 
identification 
 
of 
 
needs 
 
based 
 
on 
 
assessing 
 
employees' 
competencies, 
 
measurement 
 
of 
 
learning 
 
effectiveness, 
 
integration 
 
of 
 
education 
 
with 
 
other 
 
processes 
 
and 
 
selection 
 
of 
appropriate educational tools. 
KN 
 
encourages 
 
the 
 
personal 
 
development 
 
of 
 
its 
 
employees 
 
and 
 
provides 
 
them 
 
with 
 
opportunities 
 
to 
 
improve 
 
their

annually 
to profe
ssional development 
(2.5% in 
2022). In 
2023 beside
s occupational 
health and 
safety training, 
the focus 
was 
kept on 
strengthening 
project m
anagement 
and 
negotiation 
competencies 
and 
cooperation 
between departments 
to im
prove the 
focus 
on the

to 
 
provide 
 
the 
 
opportunity 
 
for 
 
a 
 
targeted 
 
group 
 
of 
 
project 
 
managers 
 
to 
 
obtain 
 
the 
 
Prince2 
certification 
in 
project 
management. 
In 
2023, 
more 
than 
50 
employees 
used 
this 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen 
their 
skills 
in 
internal PM trainings, thus hel
ping KN to operate more e
ffectively. In 2023 KN started to 
prepare company processes map 
therefore 
number 
of 
trainings 
for 
all 
employees 
on 
process 
were 
organized. 
In 
addition,
 
the 
Company 
is 
providing 
the 
possibility for employees to be partially 
reimbursed for their higher 
education fees, in 2023 one employee applied for this
 
for eMBA studies.  
Total annual 
training hours 
in 
KN Lithuania
 in 
2023 
increased a 
bit 
due to
 a 
bigger num
ber of 
employees, 
and du
e to 
the 
fact that training programs were launched comparing to 2022

To 
ensure 
a 
smooth 
succession 
process, 
KN 
trains 
employees 
to 
take 
over 
the 
leadership 
of 
a 
specific 
unit 
temporarily, 
if 
necessary. 
To 
this 
end, 
management 
reserve 
training 
and 
succession 
plans 
are 
in 
place, 
encouraging 
employees 
who 
are 
considered 
potential 
future 
managers to 
acquire 
higher 
qualifications. 
This 
measure 
is also 
one 
of 
the empl
oyee motivation 
and 
career 
planning 
tools. 
In 
 
2023, 
71 
staff 
members 
with 
competencies 
in 
67 
different 
specialities 
participated 
in 
the

AB KN ENERGIES SUSTAINABILITY
 
(CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBI
LITY) REPORT 2023  
programme to ensure managerial succ
ession. In 2023, the number of internal promotions in the KN 
was recorded, with 29 
colleagues replacing their positions internally (in KN A
Ç
U, 1 person made internal career in 2023 and 1 in 2022) 
The Company has 
conducted a 360-degree feedback study for 
managers for the last fifth 
years. Following the method, KN 
Managers 
receive 
feedback 
 
on 
 
their 
behaviour 
according 
 
to 
 
the 
Company’s 
 
values 
 
and 
 
leadership 
competencies 
from 
people who 
work with them. Based 
on survey results, Manage
rs create their Personal 
development plans and 
thus grow to 
be even better leaders for their teams.  
In 2023, the 
onboarding process for 
new employees was continued 
to ensure that 
new employees who 
join the Company
 
integrate 
as 
quickly 
and 
smoothly 
as 
possible 
into 
the
 
workforce. 
The 
training 
programme 
is 
being 
updated 
regularly. 
In 
addition,  specific  training  is  provided  for  employees  returning  from 
 
maternity/paternity  leave  to  ensure  a  smooth 
adaptation process. 
Annual employee 
performance reviews are conducted 
annually with every employee; it 
allows not only for 
evaluating their 
performance, 
 
progress, 
 
and 
 
compliance 
 
with 
 
Company 
 
values 
 
but 
 
also 
 
for 
 
discussing 
 
development 
 
needs 
 
and 
 
other 
expectations and setting the goals for the new period.

OHS MANAGEMENT AND GOALS  
KN 
seeks 
to 
provide 
a 
working 
environment 
that 
meets 
strict 
standards 
of 
safety 
and 
well-being. 
As 
a 
terminal 
operator,
 
KN 
provides and 
maintains 
a 
h
ealth 
and safety 
management 
system to 
ensure 
safety 
performance based 
on legislation 
and 
industry 
best 
 
practices, 
 
with 
clear 
commitments, 
 
targets, 
and 
responsibilities. 
 
The 
Company's 
 
objective 
 
is 
 
to 
create 
 
an 
environment 
where 
occupational 
health 
and 
safety 
risks 
are 
controlled 
to 
prevent 
injuries, 
accidents, 
and 
occupational 
diseases and
 to identify, 
assess and
 manage 
risk
s arising
 from unsafe
 conditions, occupational 
injuries and 
illnesses related 
to 
work 
processes 
or 
the 
working 
environment. 
It 
also 
focuses 
on 
educating 
workers 
to 
understand 
better 
their 
role 
in 
reducing negative environme
n
tal impacts and 
that the health and 
safety of themselves and others 
are the highest value 
of
 
every worker. 
The 
 
Occupational 
 
H
ealth 
 
and 
 
Safety 
 
Management 
 
System 
(OHS) 
applies 
to 
all 
professionals 
working 
at 
and 
maintaining 
the 
 
terminals 
 
operated 
 
by 
 
KN, 
 
whether 
 
employed 
 
by 
 
the 
Company 
 
or 
 
other 
 
companies 
 
and 
 
engaged 
 
in 
 
developing
 
international LNG terminal project
s. 
 
Legal 
acts, 
best 
industry 
practices 
and 
clear 
obligations, 
objectives 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
terminal 
operator 
regulate
 
the 
implementation 
of 
measures 
of 
this 
system. 
OSH 
requires 
strong 
management 
commitment, 
employee 
engagement, 
and continuous improvement. The safety and health mana
gement system aims to prevent accidents at the 
workplace and 
occupational 
diseases, 
to 
ensure 
safe 
and 
h
ealthy 
workplaces, 
eliminate 
potential 
hazards 
and 
reduce 
risks 
to 
the 
safety 
and health of employees by taking effective prevention and protection measures.

KN 
 
is 
 
certified 
 
according 
 
to 
 
the 
 
Occupational 
Health 
and 
Saf
ety 
Management 
Sy
stem 
standard 
ISO 
45001:2018. 
 
It 
 
applies 
to 
 
all 
 
activities 
of 
 
KN 
terminals 
 
in 
 
Lithuania, 
 
including 
 
international 
business 
 
development. 
 
In 
 
the 
 
end 
 
of 
 
2023 
 
DNV 
performed 
 
a 
 
recertification 
 
audit 
 
of 
 
the 
 
ISO 
certification 
 
process 
 
to 
 
maintain 
 
certification 
 
of 
the management system. The 
key objective of the 
audit  was 
 
to 
 
determine  the
  conformity 
 
of 
 
the 
management  system  with  the  standards  
–
  ISO 
45001:2018, 
 
as 
 
well 
 
as 
 
ISO 
 
9001:2015, 
 
and 
 
IS
O 
14001:2015, 
 
being 
 
amongst 
 
them. 
Nonconformities 
 
haven’t 
 
been 
 
identified 
 
during 
this audit, 
some suggestions for 
the improvement 
were made. 
In 
addition, 
internal 
audits 
of 
the 
KN 
management 
system 
are 
carried 
out 
by 
competent 
employees 
wh
o 
can 
understand 
the 
risks 
and 
opportunities 
associated 
with 
the 
audit 
principles 
and 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
audit, 
as 
well 
as 
apply 
audit 
criteria, 
appropriate 
principles, 
pro
cedures, 
and 
m
ethods 
in 
different 
audits 
an
d 
know 
applicable 
l
egislation 
and 
can 
ensure 
that 
audits are 
carried 
out 
consistently 
and systematically. 
In 
2023, 
25 
internal audits 
(in 
2022 
–
 
13, 2021 
–
 
6) 
were conducted, 
18 of which in the area of safety. 
One 
 
of  the 
 
main  strategic 
 
objectives  of 
 
KN  is 
 
the  continuous 
 
improvement  of 
 
the  occupational 
 
safety  and 
 
health 
management 
s
ystem 
by 
 
ensuring 
proper 
compliance 
and 
improvement 
of 
 
the 
 
safety 
culture 
to 
achieve 
a 
zero 
rate 
 
of 
significant safety incidents and accidents.   
KN 
uses 
measurable 
indicators 
to 
monitor 
the 
safety 
and 
health 
of 
workers, 
namely 
the 
number 
of 
critical 
incidents, 
Number 
of 
process 
safety 
incidents, 
Occupational 
accident 
fr
equency 
rate 
(LTIR) 
and 
Frequency 
of 
near 
misses 
or
 
potential 
safety 
incidents (IR). 
In 
2023 KN, 
as the 
main HSE 
indicator 
started to 
use TRCF 
(total recorda
ble case 
frequency) which re
presents
 
the 
 
total 
 
number 
 
of 
 
fatalities, 
 
lost 
 
time 
 
injuries, 
 
alternate 
 
work, 
 
and 
 
other 
 
injuries 
 
requiring 
 
medical 
 
treatment. 
 
TRCF 
provides 
a 
 
co
mprehensive 
view 
of 
 
safety 
 
incidents, 
 
including 
 
minor 
injuries 
and 
medical 
treatments, 
not 
just 
lost 
time 
injuries. 
It 
captures 
a 
broader 
spectrum 
of 
incidents, 
allowing 
organizations 
to 
address health 
and 
safety
 
risks 
holistically
, 
encourages proactive 
risk 
managem
ent bey
ond just 
focusing 
on 
lost 
time 
injuries, 
reflects 
the 
overall 
safety 
performance 
more accurately. Together 
these indicators are 
used for measuring occupational 
safety and health management e
fficiency. 
They help KN 
assess its 
occupational safety 
and 
health (OSH) 
performance and ben
chmark itself against 
other compani
es 
in Lithuania and worldwide.  
The 
Company has 
set 
goals 
related 
to 
all 
four 
of 
these 
indicators 
–
 
TRCF 
should 
not 
exceed 
0.73 
in 
2024 
(< 
0.5 
on 
2030), 
the 
number of 
Critical 
and Process 
safety incidents 
should 
be 0 
annually, 
LTIR should 
reach 
≤0.5 in 
2024 (≤0.5 
in 
2030), and 
IR should reach ≥80 in 2024 (≥100 in 2030). Respective actions to achieve this are planned.
 
The goal for TRCF in 2023 was not exceed 0.8 and the goal was achieved 
–
 TRCF for 2023 is 0.

In 
2023, 
there 
were 
no 
critical 
incidents 
in 
th

All 
 
process 
 
safety 
 
incidents 
 
were 
 
investigated, 
 
and
 
corrective measures were provided. 
HAZARD IDENTIFICATION, RISK ASSESSMENT AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 
KN implements an 
initial risk 
assessment of 
workplaces and 
continual risk ass
essment of work
-related 
hazards before 
any 
work is planned and carried out. These procedures are implemented using the following means: 
▪
 
 
Occupational risk 
assessment, 
which is 
carried 
out at 
each workplace 
and 
repeated as 
the 
nature of 
work change
s, 
new materials, chemicals, equipment or new processes are being used;

In 
2023 
KN 
continued 
the 
implementation 
of 
various 
measures 
for 
the 
safety 
of 
employees, 
as 
well 
as 
implemented 
ne

measures: 
New 
safety 
inspection 
and 
walk 
around 
procedure 
was 
int
roduced, 
which 
involved 
all 
level 
employees 
into 
safety 
walk 
downs. 
“Safety talk” system implemented, wi
th monthly safety talks on selected safety topic with different O&M de
partments and 
shifts.  
Continuous 
improvement

contin
ues, 
the 
internal 
trainings and inductions for most employees is carried out on a digital training platform. 
For O&M 
department 
workers, special 
safety 
information 
boards 
have been 
installed 
where relevant 
safety 
information i
s 
updated periodically. 
The 
“Safety 
bypass” 
procedure, 
focusing 
on 
bypasses 
by 
OHS 
specialists 
and 
department 
heads, 
and 
standardised 
safet
y 
inspection 
questionnaires 
have 
been 
prepared. 
Following 
the 
analysis 
of 
bypasses, 
additional 
safety 
measures 
have 
been 
implemented. 
The new 
Risk 
Assessment Procedure 
has 
been prepared 
–
 it 
defines 
the Co
mpany's professional 
risk asse
ssments and 
the 
periodic risk 
assessment 
of ro
utine and 
non-
routine work. 
A 
three-year 
occupational risk
 assessment 
contract 
was signe
d 
with 
an 
independent 
third 
party 
–
 
it 
allows 
for 
prompt 
occupational 
risk 
assessment 
in 
the 
event 
of 
changes 
in 
working 
conditions. 
Since 2022, 
the 
agreement 
template 
with 
contracting 
organisations, 
obliging 
organisations 
working 
in 
the 
territory 
of 
KN 
to provide basic safety indicators and KN to 
control how safety requirements are met is used. It 
is important to st
ress that 
rules 
are 
also 
foreseen 
in 
which 
cases 
(for 
which 
offences) 
the 
contractor 
may 
be 
deprived 
of 
permission 
to 
work 
for 
KN. 
Furthermore, the representatives of the contractors are also 
obliged to pass a briefing on work safety 
requirements at our 
terminals. 
Safet

provisions 
are 
also 
included 
in 
the 
Code 
of 
Ethics 
for

which 
is 
integrated 
into 
the 
procurement process of KN. 
The 
change 
management 
system 
implemented 
in 
the 
Company 
also 
requires 
all 
planned 
process

changes 
to 
be 
evaluated 
through 
a

Near 
misses, unsafe 
conditions 
or any 
hazard re
porting is 
an integral 
part 
of promoting 
a 
s
afety 
culture in 
the 
organisation.
 
In 2023, 
368 
reports were 
received 
on 
near 
misses or 
potential safety 
incidents 
(IR) 
(2022 
–
 
304, 
2021 
–
 282). 
KN 
fosters a
 
no
-blame culture and awards 
the most
 active employees for
 reporting any 
noticed hazards 
or near misses. 
For those who 
seek to be unnoticed, KN provides the possibility to report anonymously. 
The 
 
investigation 
 
of 
 
work-related 
 
incidents 
 
covers 
 
the 
 
generally 
 
accepted 
 
eight-stage 
 
process 
 
of 
 
investigation 
 
of 
accidents/incidents: 
gathering

The

has 
 
shown 
 
consistency 
 
in 
 
its 
 
transparency 
 
dimension, 
 
which 
 
includes 
 
its 
 
focus 
 
on 
 
anti

practices 
and sustainabil
ity reporting. 
In 202
3 the 
transparency 
dimension of 
KN 
was 
evaluated A+, 
the 
same as 
in 
previous 
years. 
Information on Management structure (including the composition of various management bodies and their activities) and 
compliance 
with

PREVENTION
 
OF
 
ANTI-COMPETITIVE
 
BEHAVIOUR
 
Currently, 
the 
Group's 
activities 
can 
be 
d
ivided 
into 
three 
main 
segments: 
liquid 
terminals, 
LNG 
activities 
–
 
consisting 
of 
regulated 
LNG 
activities 
(activities 
with 
a 
st
ate 
interest) 
and 
commercial 
LNG 
activities 
(
international 
projects 
and 
sm
all
-
scale 
LNG operations). The 
Management of 
KN evaluates 
the financial 
results of each 
segment and 
sets individual 
strategic 
goals.   
The regulated LNG activities segment inc
lud
es the activity of the 
LNG terminal in Klaipėda, which receives, stores liquefied 
natural 
gas, 
 
regasifies, 
 
and 
 
supplies 
 
it 
to 
the 
main 
gas 
pipeline. 
The 
fixed 
and 
variable 
parts 
 
of 
 
the 
 
price 
apply 
 
to 
 
the 
terminal's 
servi
ces. 
They 
are 
approved 
annually 
by 
the 
National 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Council 
of 
Lithuania 
(from 
now 
on 
–
 
NERC). 
The 
LNG 
terminal 
fully 
ensures 
the 
third-party 
access 
requirements 
following 
EU 
laws. 
The 
terminal's 
activities 
are 
organised 
in 
 
observance 
 
of 
 
the 
 
Regulations 
 
for 
 
using 
 
the 
 
Liquefied 
 
Natural 
 
G
as 
 
Te
rminal 
 
(from 
 
now 
 
on 
 
- 
 
Terminal 
 
r
egulations), 
adopted after public 
consultations with market participants 
and approved by NERC. 
The terminal's capacities are al
located 
to the users 
on the same 
conditions, following the 
public and 
transparent capacity allocation 
procedures or Spot 
capacity 
allocation procedures in case free capacities are left.  
In 
September 
2022, 
4 
LNG 
terminal 
capacity 
packages 
of 
6 
TWh/year 
(24 
TWh) 
were 
allocated 
to 
Klaipėda 
LNG 
terminal 
users from Lithuania, Latvia and Poland for a ten-year period until 2033, starting from January 1st 2023. The renewed LNG 
terminal 
capacity 
allocation 
model 
will 
allow 
to 
allocate 
around 
60% 
of 
the 
total 
LNG 
terminal 
capacity 
over 
the 
next 
10 
years 
to long-term 
contract users. 
Additionally, in 
2023 KN 
carried out 
additional capacity 
allocation procedure 
for 
another 
9 
TWh 
of 
terminal 
capacity 
each 
year 
in 
2025
–
2032, 
which 
were 
equally 
distributed 
among 
3 
companies 
from 
Lithuania, 
Estonia 
and 
Norway. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
capacity 
allocation 
in 
2022 
and 
2023, 
full 
occupancy 
of 
the 
Klaipėda 
LNG 
terminal 
is 
ensured until 2033. 
Allocating 
capacity 
ten 
years 
in 
advance 
ensures 
that 
the 
market 
will 
be 
able 
to 
meet 
not onl
y the 
gas 
demand 
of 
Lithuanian 
consumers but also transmission to other European countries and storage in the Latvian gas storage facility.  
LNG  terminal 
 
ensures  a 
 
multiuser  environment,  i. 
 
e.  allows  sever
al  terminal  users 
 
to  use 
 
services
  of 
 
LNG  terminal 
simultaneously 
based 
on 
mandatory 
borrowing/lending 
conditions.

This 
Policy 
expressly 
and 
publicly 
declares 
rejection 
of 
bribery, 
fraud, 
extortion, 
the 
creation 
of 
unofficial 
accounts, 
the 
execution 
of 
 
unofficial

The 
provisions 
of 
the 
Standard 
of 
Conduct 
and 
the 
principle 
of 
Zero 
Tolerance 
for 
Corruption 
as 
well 
as 
procedures

bodies, 
third 
parties 
 
acting 
 
on 
behalf 
of 
 
the 
 
Company, 
and 
KN 
 
clients 
 
and 
partners. 
All 
employees of 
the Company are familiar 
with the 
Anti
-Bribery and
 Anti-Corruption Policy and the 
Code of Conduct and 
are
 
committed to complying with their provisions. Appropriate training is also provided to employees. 
In 
2023, 
there 
were 
no 
reported 
cases 
of 
corruption 
in 
the 
Company.
 
No 
cases 
related 
to 
bribery 
of 
foreign 
officials 
were 
registered 
in 
th
e 
Company as well.  
Gift 
 
regulation 
 
is 
 
another 
 
important 
 
area 
 
related 
 
to 
 
preventing
 
corruption 
and 
bribery. 
KN 
Group 
has 
related 
regulations 
in 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and Anti-bribe
ry and 
Anti-corruption 
Policy, 
stating 
that empl
oyees of 
KN 
do 
not 
accept 
or offer 
gifts, 
including 
cash, 
securities, 
gift 
vouchers, 
various 
services, 
etc., 
which 
may 
damage 
the 
reputation 
of 
KN 
employees 
or 
business 
partners 
or reduce their credibility. 
Intolerance of gifts 
due to the posi
tions held and a questionnaire 
(to assess the acceptability of
 
the 
gift 
or 
hospitality) 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Policy as 
well. KN 
has cl
early 
defined proc
edures 
f
or 
the 
acceptance 
of 
permissible 
and 
impermissible 
gifts 
and 
other 
benefits 
–
 
since 
201
9, 
a 
register 
of 
gifts, 
in 
which 
all 
gifts
 
received 
must 
be 
registered, 
has been operating. 
The 
KN 
Gift 
Policy 
was 
updat
ed 
on 
08/01/2023. 
The 
policy 
has 
been 
supplemented 
wit
h 
a 
separate 
clause 
regarding 
the 
intolerance of 
receiving 
gifts 
from 
one 
person 
on a 
regular 
basis.
 
The 
Policy 
regulates in 
detail 
the 
implementation 
of 
KN 
employees' zero tolerance for corruption in the spheres of the appropriate acceptance of gifts from 
existing and potential 
business partners, customers and suppliers, as well 
as proper provision of gifts to existing and potential business partners, 
customers 
and 
suppliers. 
The 
Policy also 
establishes the 
procedure 
for
 
declaring 
and 
registering 
gifts, exce
pt in 
c
ases 
where 
regulatory 
rights 
Acts 
prohibit 
accepting 
and 
giving 
gifts. 
The 
value 
of 
gifts 
for 
representation 
is
 
EUR 
150, 
following 
th
e 
regulations of the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interests of the Republic of Lithuania. 
The 
Company 
has 
control 
mechanisms 
to 
identify, 
assess 
and 
monitor 
potential 
corruption 
risk 
factors. 
While 
assessing 
corruption risks, KN analyses the activities and processes of each business segment, compiling a list of corruption risks.  
The most relevant risks identified are: 
1)
 
 
Large-scale  procurement. 
 
The 
 
Company 
 
m
akes  efforts 
 
to 
 
ensure 
 
a 
 
tr
ansparent  process 
 
of 
 
preparation 
 
o
f 
procurement documents, selection and execution of the procurement method while maintaining confidentiality.  
2)
 
 
Management 
of 
oil 
product 
handling 
contracts. 
The 
Company 
aims 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
in 
determining 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
of 
such 
contracts, 
the 
management 
of 
the 
contract 
execution 
process 
and 
customer 
due 
diligence procedures. 
Reports 
are 
regularly 
submitted 
to 
the 
Board 
to 
manage 
and 
mitigate 
these 
risks. 
KN 
also 
has 
a 
risk 
event 
register 
in 
the 
document management system, contributing to more efficient risk management within the Company. 
Once  a 
 
year,  KN  performs  a 
 
special  assessment  of 
 
the  likelihood  of 
 
corruption.  In  2023  analysis  of 
 
separation  of 
responsibilities 
of 
functions 
in 
the 
Company'
s 
internal 
processes 
was 
performed. 
However, 
due 
to 
the
 
changes 
of 
KN’s 
organisational 
structure 
the investigation 
finalized 
and 
results of 
it 
are 
planned to 
be 
summarized 
in the 
beginning 
of 
2024.
 
The 
risk 
of 
corruption 
is 
also 
assessed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
development 
of 
international 
projects, 
considering 
both 
externa
l 
and 
internal 
factors 
and 
the 
level 
of 
 
corruption 
 
risk 
 
in 
the 
country. 
Additional 
control 
measures 
include 
due 
 
diligence
 
procedure
s.
 
To 
 
reduce 
 
the 
 
likelihood 
 
of 
 
corruption, 
 
increase 
 
transparency, 
 
and 
 
enc
ourage 
 
fair 
 
business, 
 
KN 
 
applies 
 
due 
 
diligence 
procedures not 
only to 
its employees in 
Lithuania and 
Brazil but also 
to its business 
partners. The 
procedure is

procedure 
requires 
written 
confirmation 
from 
another 
party 
that 
it 
accepts 
and 
undertakes 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Anti-bribery

Anti-corruption Poli
cy and
 Code
 of 
Conduct of 
KN. The
 
anti-corruption 
provisions and the commitment to 
comply with them are also included in 
cooperation agreements with business partners 
(anti-corruption 
clauses). 
 
In 
 
order 
 
to 
 
ensure 
 
the 
 
prevention 
 
of 
 
bribery 
 
of 
 
foreign 
officials 
 
(in 
 
transactions 
 
with 
 
foreign 
companies), in 
accordance with the 
KN code of 
ethics, the 
principles provided for 
in the anti-bribery 
and corruption policy, 
a due diligence 
procedure of clients is 
carried out, 
during which they 
are asked to 
indicate in a 
questionnaire whether th
e 
client's 
leading 
persons 
are 
pol
itically 
influenced 
persons 
[PIP] 
, 
whether 
the 
company 
or 
the 
leading

have 
been 
prosecuted 
or 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
a 
pre

as well 
as breaches of 
the requirements 
set out in 
the KN 
's
 internal 
procedures 
and the 
Code

Employees 
are encouraged 
to 
report 
possible cases 
or 
manifestations 
of 
corruption via 
SpeakUp@kn.lt
 or anonymous
ly using the respective form at 
www.kn.lt
. These 
channels can be used by 
the 
Company's employees and any other interested parties.   
This 
 
whistleblowing 
 
procedure 
 
works 
 
across 
 
the 
 
Group, 
 
including 
 
the 
 
Br
azilian 
 
subsidiary, 
 
and 
 
establish
es
 
 
sustainable 
principles 
for 
the 
protection 
and 
confidentiality 
of 
whistle

The 
procedure 
provides 
that 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
information 
received 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
internal 
audit 
department 
of 
KN, 
which 
is 
functionally

apply directly to 
the collegial bodies of 
the 
KN 
(Audit Committee 
and 
the Supervisory

as well as recommendations on what should be paid attention to and assessed before accepting or giving gifts. 
In 
2023
 
two 
notifications 
of 
low 
significance 
were receiv
ed 
via 
Speak-
Up
 
channel: 
none 
of 
the 
reports 
related 
to 
possible 
corruption or fraud, and the Company reacted according to the relevant procedures.  
KN 
 
has 
 
a 
 
system 
 
for 
 
the 
 
declaration 
 
of 
 
private 
 
interests.
 
 
Members 
 
of 
 
the 
 
Company's 
 
collegiate 
 
management 
 
bodies, 
managers 
and 
employees 
included 
in 
the 
established 
and 
publicly 
disclosed 
list 
of 
positions 
and 
all 
employees 
participating 
in 
KN 
's
 
public 
procurement 
declare 
their 
private 
interests 
through 
the 
publicly 
available 
PINREG 
database 
of 
the 
Chief 
Ethics Commission (CEC). The 
list of positions for declaring 
interests is constantly reviewed and updated. In 2023, 
173 staff 
members of KN submitted their declarations in the PINREG database.  
KN 
has 
the procedure 
for the 
Declaration 
of 
Private Interests 
and 
Management 
of 
Conflicts of 
Interest 
and 
a 
separate Policy 
on 
the 
Management 
of 
Private 
Interests.
 
This 
Policy 
aims 
to 
establish 
the 
principles 
and 
measures 
for 
preventing 
public 
and private 
conflicts 
of interest 
in 
the KN 
Group 
by 
ensuring the 
proper 
functioning of 
the 
conflict
-
of
-interest 
prevention 
system 
and 
creating 
an 
environment 
unfavourable 
to 
c
orruption. 
The 
Policy 
establishes 
 
the 
basic 
pr
inciples 
of 
interest 
management and 
measures of
 conflict-
of
-interest 
management, 
which are 
applied to 
all employees 
of 
the KN
 
Group an
d 
members of governing and supervisory bodies. 
KN follows 
the 
Procedure 
and 
Policy 
when 
setting 
the 
requirements 
for the 
conduct of 
its 
employees 
or 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
conflict 
of 
interest. 
Staff 
members 
are 
regularly

It revealed 
that 
the level 
of intolerance 
of corruption 
in 
KN
 
is quite 
high: 96
% 
of employees 
would 
report
 
cases of

PROCUREMENT
 
PRACTICES
 
KN 
regularly 
carries 
out 
high
-value 
procurement 
procedur
es. 
When 
performing 
the 
pr
ocedure, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
ensure 
transparency, 
corruption 
prevention, 
and 
effective 
and 
sust
ainable 
use 
of 
resources. 
In 
addition, 
KN 
aims 
to 
ensure 
that 
confidential information 
is not disclosed during 
the procurement process 
and that due diligence
 is carried out on 
business 
partners, service providers or other third parties before contracts are signed.  
While planning and implementing procurements and the performance of procurement agreements, 
KN acts following the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Law 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Lithuania 
on 
Procurement 
by 
Entities 
Operatin
g 
in

and 
applicable  to 
 
the

practic
e 
 
even 
 
then 
 
the 
 
Law 
 
does 
 
not 
 
apply 
 
to 
 
specific 
procurements. 
 
KN 
 
has 
 
internal  proc
urement  standards 
 
that  me
et  and 
 
even  e
xceed  the 
 
Law  on 
 
Public 
 
Procurement
 
requirements. 
The 
planning, 
conduct 
and 
conclusion 
of 
procurement 
are 
governed 
by 
Company’s 
documents 
specifically 
designed 
to 
regulate 
procurement: 
the 
Procurement 
Procedure, 
the 
Procurement 
Committee 
Regulations 
and 
the 
Procedure 
for 
the 
Organisation 
 
of 
 
Small 
 
Value 
 
Procurement. 
 
KN’s
 
 
procurement 
 
is 
 
planned, 
 
and 
 
the 
 
Procurement 
 
Summary 
 
is 
 
publishe
d 
following 
the 
procedure 
in 
the 
 
Law 
 
on 
 
Public 
Procurement. 
 
The 
Company's 
procurement 
is 
usually 
carried 
out 
by 
 
th
e 
Procurement Organiser (for low-value procurement) or the Procurement Commission (for higher-value procurement). 
All 
persons involve
d in 
the 
Company's 
procurement 
activitie
s, 
and 
those who 
can 
directly 
or indirectly 
influence 
them, 
must 
sign 
declarations 
of 
impartiality 
and 
confidentiality 
undertakings. 
To 
prevent 
potential 
conflicts 
of
 
interest, 
all 
employees 
of 
the 
Company 
involved 
in 
the 
organisation's 
procurement 
processes 
must 
declare 
their 
p
rivate 
interests 
through 
the
 
publicly available PINREG database of the Chief Ethics Commission system of the Chief Ethics Commission.  
The Company makes 
its procurement contracts 
publicly available following 
the procedures laid 
down by the 
Law. KN 
also 
prepares and 
submits 
to 
the 
Public Procur
ement Servic
e of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Lithuania 
a 
report 
on 
procurement procedure 
for 
each 
procurement carried 
out 
(where 
required by 
the Law) 
and 
a re
port on 
purchase 
contracts 
for all 
purchase 
contracts 
concluded in a calendar year. 
Since 2021, 
the Ecocost 
Procurement 
Management Syst
em has been 
used to 
manage the 
entire 
procurement process. 
All 
procurement 
activities 
are 
c
arried 
out 
electronically, 
with al
l ac
tions 
recorded 
and 
multi-level 
controls 
over 
decision-making 
installed. 
 
There 
 
is 
 
also 
 
a 
 
strong 
 
focus 
 
on 
 
procurement 
 
analytics 
 
to 
 
identify 
 
weaknesses 
 
in 
 
the 
 
process 
 
and 
 
make 
 
the 
necessary 
 
decisions. 
 
 
 
Daily, 
 
more 
 
than 
 
10
 
 
indicators 
 
on 
 
ongoing 
 
procurement 
 
(number 
 
of 
 
bids; 
 
staff 
 
occupancy; 
cancellations, 
e
tc.) 
are 
monitored. 
These 
indicators 
are 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
decision-making 
during 
the 
procurement 
process. 
In 
 
2023  continuously 
 
from 
 
2022  additional 
 
attention 
 
was  given 
 
to  increasing 
 
the 
 
efficiency  of 
 
processes: 
 
the  main 
procurement 
procedures 
were 
revised, 
and 
much 
attention 
was 
paid 
to 
improving 
the 
competencies 
of 
employees 
who 
initiate 
procurement in 
the field 
of procure
ment planning. 
 For 
that purpose, 
various 
pieces of 
training were 
organised, 
and 
methodological materials were prepared. 
Since 
 
2023, 
 
according 
 
to 
 
national 
 
regulation, 
 
all 
procurement (100%) has 
to be green 
–
 therefore, 
KN's goal 
is 
to 
have 
100% 
of 
such 
purchases
. 
In 
202
3
, 
100
% 
of 
KN's 
purchases  by  value  met  the  green  procurement  criteria
 
comparing 
 
to 
 
50% 
 
in 
 
2022
. 
 
To 
 
ensure 
 
100
% 
 
green 
procurement, Company 
is actively 
working with 
current and 
possible 
 
service 
 
providers 
 
(conducting 
 
market 
 
research 
 
and 
 
consultations), 
 
integrating 
 
environmental 
 
requirements 
 
in 
planned 
purchases, and 
conducting training 
of procurement 
organisers and 
members of 
procurement commissions 
on the 
establishment and application of green criteria.  
Since 
202
4, 
KN 
has 
approved 
the 
Code 
of 
Ethics 
for 
Suppliers, 
which 
is 
integrated 
into 
the 
procurement 
process. 
By 
applying 
this 
 
management 
 
practice, 
 
suppliers 
 
are 
 
introduced 
 
to 
 
the 
 
main 
 
ethical 
 
standards 
 
and 
 
behaviours 
 
together 
 
w
ith 
sustainability 
implementation 
practises, 
which 
 
KN 
 
expects 
 
from 
suppliers 
who 
participate 
on 
public 
 
procurements 
 
and 
execute contracts signed with KN.

uring the 
National 
Security 
of 
the 
Republic of 
Lithuani
a, 
KN is included in the second category list of compa
nies essential for ensuring national security, also liquid energy product 
terminals managed 
by the 
Company 
in Klaipėda 
and 
Subačius, 
as well as 
LNG 
terminal, 
are treated 
as f
acilities and 
assets 
essential 
for 
ensuring 
national 
security.
 
The 
individual 
requirements 
are 
provided 
in 
the 
l
egal 
acts 
aimed 
at 
ensuring 
th
e 
safety of 
the 
terminals. And 
they are 
followed both 
in 
internal procedures 
and coope
ration with 
the institutions 
that ensure 
safety.  
For 
example, 
according 
to 
the 
Resolution 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Lithuania 
No. 
746 
of 
July 
25th 
2018, 
on 
establishing 
protection 
zones 
for 
facilities 
and 
assets 
of 
national 
security, 
a 
50
-meter 
protection 
zone 
is 
established 
from 
the 
territory 
where 
the 
Klaipėda 
Liquid 
Energy 
terminal 
operates. 
It 
should 
also 
be 
noted 
that 
to 
manage 
the 
risk
s 
associated 
with 
a 
possible 
physical 
breach 
of 
the 
Klaipėda 
LNG 
terminal, 
a 
250
-meter 
preventive 
physical 
protection 
zone 
is 
set 
up 
around the LNG ter
minal, where all activities are unrelated 
to the LNG terminal are prohi
bi
ted or restricted. The 
terminal is 
guarded 
by 
Public 
Security 
Service 
(PSS) 
officers, 
who 
follow 
their 
own 
approved 
security 
procedures. 
Further 
details 
on 
regulations concerning the safety requirements of the terminals cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality requirements. 
Since Russia 
invaded Ukraine in Fe
bruary 2022, Company has 
been closely monitoring 
and analysing the 
situation, and the 
level 
of 
protection 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
managed 
by 
KN 
has 
been 
increased 
accordingly. 
For 
example, 
LNG 
gas 
carrier
s 
arriving 
in 
K
laipė
da 
are 
being 
escorted 
by 
the 
Lithuanian 
Naval 
Force 
and 
officers 
of 
the 
Lithuanian 
Police 
Anti
-Terrorist 
Operations 
 
Unit 
 
ARAS. 
 
The 
 
protection 
 
of 
 
other 
 
KN 
 
terminals 
 
was 
 
also 
 
enhanced. 
 
We 
 
regularly 
 
consult 
 
and 
 
exchange 
information with the relevant authorities. The 
overall threat level is not changed now, as we have no such ind
ications from 
the authorities responsible for national security issues. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
war 
in 
the 
neighbouring 
region, 
we 
also 
review
ed
 
potential 
threat 
scenarios 
for 
our 
operational 
and 
business 
continuity. 
We 
assessed 
the 
need 
 
for 
 
additional 
measures 
and 
implemented 
them. 
 
For 
 
example, 
 
in 
 
2022, 
KN 
invested 
about 
0.4 
million 
euros 
in 
ensuring 
the 
Company's 
operational 
continuity 
during 
extreme 
situations 
in 
energy 
security. After 
reviewing possible e
nergy supply interruption scenarios, 
we implemented addi
tional measures to guarantee 
alternative 
en
ergy 
sources 
to 
ensure 
K
N's 
critical 
functions.
 
Diesel 
generators 
were 
purchased 
to 
provide 
the 
necess
ary 
electricity 
to 
operational 
processes, 
boiler 
burner 
adaption 
to 
combined 
operation 
mode 
was 
implemented, 
and 
emergency 
lighting equipment was installed. 
In 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2023 
KN 
completed 
an 
international 
tender 
and 
is wor
king with 
a contractor 
on the 
installation of 
security technica
l 
measures, 
strengthening 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
LNG 
terminal 
and 
increasing 
 
the 
 
capabilities 
 
of
 
 
the 
 
Public 
 
security 
 
service 
 
officers 
guarding 
the 
LNG terminal 
to control 
underwater 
threats. The
 work 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
according 
to 
the 
work 
schedule 
stipulated 
in 
the contract. Improving and 
strengthening security is an 
ongoing process 
–
 tools are improving an
d new opportu
nities to 
increase security are emerging, requiring constant attention and interagency 
cooperation. This equipment installed by KN 
is 
 
a 
 
com
ponent 
 
of 
 
the 
 
whole 
 
system. 
 
The 
 
acquired 
 
equipment 
 
will 
 
be 
 
integrated 
 
together 
 
with 
 
th
e 
 
systems 
 
of 
 
other 
institutions, 
 
additionally 
 
strengthening 
 
the 
 
security 
 
of 
 
the 
 
terminal 
 
in 
 
a 
 
complex 
 
mann
er. 
 
The 
 
price 
 
of 
 
the 
 
concluded 
contract is about 1.5 million. EUR. 
Various 
Regulations 
on 
the 
prevention, 
response, 
and 
investigation 
of 
industrial 
a
ccidents 
that 
a 
valid 
in 
Lithuania 
state 
that the safe use of haz
ardous establishments and safety 
control is the resp
onsibility of the 
operator 
of the terminals. T
he 
operator must ensure the safe use of the dangerous establishment, take the necessary measures to prevent accidents and 
limit 
their 
consequences for 
the 
population 
and the

Therefore,

to incidents 
is 
one 
of the key topics for KN.  
The 
internal 
emergency 
plans 
for 
the 
LNG 
and 
liquid 
energy 
terminals 
are
 
periodically 
reviewed 
and 
updated, 
training 
is 
carried 
out, 
and 
information 
on 
the 
safety 
status 
and 
preventive 
measu
res 
in 
place 
is 
provided 
to 
the 
authorities 
at 
the
 
required frequency and for communities. In an industrial accident, KN staff and the responsible authorities would respond 
following the plans drawn up and agreed upon, and residents would be informed accordingly.

AB KN ENERGIES SUSTAINABILITY
 
(CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBI
LITY) REPORT 2023  
The Company 
is constantly investing in 
safety measures and activities re
lated to employees' readiness for 
emergencies (by 
regularly 
organising 
relevant 
employee 
training) 
and 
measures 
to 
increase 
civil 
safety. 
Since 
2022, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
events 
in 
Ukraine, 
KN
 
paid 
much 
attention 
to 
the 
review 
of
 
response 
processes, 
communication and 
information-sharing 
practices, 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
employees. 
Training 
on 
resilience 
was 
org
anised w
ith 
internal 
discussions 
about 
how 
to 
behave 
during 
a 
war
, 
civil 
safety 
training 
was 
also 
organised 
for 
 
Vitė 
and 
Melnragė 
community 
representatives. 
Safety 
information 
 
for 
 
the 
 
public 
 
is 
 
available 
 
at 
 
KN’s

CYBERSECURITY
 
AND
 
DATA
 
PROTECTION 
Cyber 
risks 
are 
the 
potential 
for 
unauthorised 
access, 
use, 
disclosure, 
disruption, 
modification, 
or 
destruction of 
data 
and 
systems 
by 
cybercriminals 
or 
malicious 
actors.
 
 
KN 
manages 
the 
country's 
critical 
energy 
infrastructure 
and 
is 
one 
of 
t
he 
potential 
target
s 
of 
cyber-attacks. 
Therefore, 
cyber 
security 
is 
one 
of 
the 
priority 
areas 
to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
Company’s 
data, processes, infrastructure, and operations.  
The 
National 
Cyber 
Security 
Centre 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Defence 
evaluates 
the 
readiness 
of 
the 
most
 
important 
entities 
for 
 
cyber 
 
defence, 
 
gives 
 
additional 
 
instructi
ons 
 
on 
 
the 
 
essential 
 
measures 
 
that 
 
must 
 
be 
 
implemented, 
 
and 
 
provides 
intelligence 
related 
to 
 
preventive 
cyber 
 
defence. 
 
The 
same 
 
applies 
 
in 
the 
 
case 
 
of 
 
KN, 
 
and 
Company's 
 
management 
 
is 
responsible 
for 
applying 
r
elevant 
measures. 
KN’s 
cyber 
security 
is 
governed 
by 
the 
KN 
Information 
and 
Cyber 
Security 
Policy, publicly available on KN’s website, 
and
 Information 
Security Risk Management Guidelines, 
including organisational 
and technical provisions of the Cyber Law of Lithuania.  The Company has also set minimal information and cyber securit
y 
requirements 
 
for 
 
third 
 
parties. 
 
Information 
 
can 
 
be 
 
found

It is important to note 
that Lithuania has already taken the threats posed by the 
Eastern neighbourhood seriously, and the 
institutions' demands regarding business continuity and
 cyber security were relatively high even 
before the war in Ukraine 
started. 
Therefore, 
KN 
continuously 
invested 
in 
respective 
areas 
to 
improve 
Company's 
resilience 
to 
cyber 
threats. 
KN's 
regular 
activities 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
cybersecurity 
include 
threats 
intelligence, 
v
ulnerability 
ma
nagement, 
sec
urity 
ass
essments, 
protection 
and 
detection 
capabilities, 
and 
business 
continuity 
management. 
 
In 
addition, 
employee 
training 
on 
these 
topics, 
following the best cybersecurity practices, is being organised regularly.  
A
t 
the 
 
beginning 
 
of 
 
Russia’s 
 
invasion 
 
of 
Ukraine 
 
an
d 
during 
 
202
3,
 
KN 
 
observed 
a 
 
sev
eral-fold 
 
increase 
 
in 
the 
flow 
 
of
 
malicious 
emails 
and 
cyber
-
attacks 
attempting 
to 
compromise 
the
 
Company’s 
IT 
infrastructure. 
H
owever, 
no 
significant 
incidents occurred, as preventive measures were appli
ed promptly and appropriately. Furthermore, KN initiated additional 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
detection 
and 
recovery 
capabilities. 
KN 
does 
not 
outsource 
operational 
business 
processes 
(e.g., 
IT services) to Russian or Belarussian service providers. 
KN 
constantly 
assesses 
and 
improves 
its 
internal 
legislation 
and 
processes 
of
 
personal 
data 
protection. 
Key 
documents 
which 
define 
data 
handling 
and 
storage 
processes 
and 
ensuring 
data 
privacy
 
in 
KN 
are 
the 
Personal 
D
ata 
Privacy 
Policy, 
Website 
Visitor 
Privacy 
and 
Cookie 
Policy, 
Guidelines 
of 
Personal 
Data 
Processing 
and 
Personal 
Data 
P
rivacy 
Policy 
for
 
candidates for positions of employees, interns and governing and supervisory bodies. 
KN 
 
has 
 
a 
 
dedicated 
 
Data 
 
Protection 
 
Officer 
 
who 
 
monitors 
 
the 
 
compliance 
 
of 
 
KN 
 
with 
 
all 
 
data 
 
protection 
 
legislation,
 
including 
audits, 
awareness-raising 
and 
training 
of 
staff 
involved 
in 
data 
processing 
ope
rations. 
The 
officer 
also 
ensures 
that the Company receives timely information about its obligations and is in a position to implement them properly. 
The Company has 
sustained its General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) initiatives by enhancing the 
quality of personal 
data 
registers 
in 
2023. 
Policies 
have 
been 
updated 
to 
align 
with 
the 
current 
Company 
situation, 
ensuring 
relevance 
and 
compliance. 
KN employees were 
introduced with 
all 
updates made to 
ensure their 
awareness of 
actual regulations 
applied
. 
Additionally, 
investments 
have 
been 
made 
i
n 
educating 
employees 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
personal 
data 
gathered 
through
 
their  ac
tivities,  fostering  aw
areness
  and 
 
understanding.  Training 
 
on  how 
 
to  manage 
 
personal  data 
 
appropriately  is 
mandatory for all employees. It is carried out once a year and was implemented in 2023 as well.  
In 2023, KN did not receive any complaints regarding improper processing of personal data in a
ny of its operations.
