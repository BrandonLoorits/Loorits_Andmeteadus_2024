MESSAGE FROM T
HE CEO
 
 
Dear 
All,
 
Last year 
2023 was 
the second 
consecutive successful year 
for the 
Rok
iškio sūris 
Group. 
Although the 
situat
ion 
on 
the 
exp
ort 
mark
ets 
deter
iorated 
sharply 
compared 
to 
2022, 
with 
a 
drop 
in 
pric
es 
and 
demand 
for 
products, 
the 
comp
any 
ach
ieved 
g
ood 
fin
ancial 
resul
ts. 
This 
is 
thanks 
to 
a 
professional 
and, 
most 
i
mportantly
, 
cohesi
ve 
team. 
In
 
2023, RECORDS were 
achieved for 
the 
production of 
cheese, milk 
sugar and 
fres
h 
dairy products. 
The 
production 
of 
v
arious 
types 
of 
ch
eese 
alone 
a
mounted 
to 
39 
50
0 
tonnes 
for 
the
 
year
. 
This 
is 
neither 
high 
nor 
low
, 
which 
means 
that 
every 
day 
of 
the 
year
, 
including 
weekends 
and 
h
olidays, 
we 
produc
ed 
more 
than 
100 
(HUNDRED) 
tonnes 
of 
cheese. 
That 
is 
cert
ainly 
s
om
ething 
to 
be 
proud 
of. 
I 
would 
also 
l
ike 
to
 
high
light 
the 
success of the previous projects: I would single out the production of 
co
ttage cheese in Utena, which exceeded 
all 
expectations 
i
n 
terms 
of 
quality 
and 
quant
ity
. 
The 
q
uality 
of 
th
e 
production 
and
 
th
e 
modern 
m
anagement 
of
 
the 
production process 
are 
confirmed 
by 
t
he 
high 
r
atings 
under 
t
he 
international 
f
ood 
safety 
a
nd 
quality 
sta
ndard 
IFS, which has been succ
essfully upgrad
ed in all the 
Group's companies.
 
The 
stron
g 
f
inancial 
performance
 
also
 
a
llowed 
us 
to 
i
ncrease 
s
taff 
salaries 
in 
2023 
by 
more 
than 
t
he 
av
erage 
salary 
increase 
in 
Lithuania. 
The 
company 
continued 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
its 
employees 
by 
organising 
and f
inancing 
various 
grou
p an
d i
ndiv
idual 
training 
co
urses. 
We are 
comm
itted t
o 
continuing 
these 
activ
ities 
in 
the future.
 
In 
2023, 
as 
in 
previous 
y
ears, 
the
 
company 
devoted 
considerable 
attention, 
fina
ncial 
an
d 
human
 
resources 
to 
the 
 
promotion 
 
of
 
 
the 
 
S
ustainability 
 
Philosop
hy
. 
 
More 
 
on 
 
this 
 
in 
 
the 
 
Social 
 
Responsibi
lity 
 
and 
 
Sust
ainability 
Report.
 
As 
good as 
2023 was, 
it was 
not 
w
ithout problems 
and challenges. 
(In fact, 
someo
ne 
once said: 
if 
your business 
has no problems, you are bankrupt). One of them 
w
as to successfully sell record volumes of production. This i
s 
certainly 
not a
n easy
 c
hallenge, g
iven that 
geo
political 
tensions 
in 
the 
world 
continue 
unabated, 
wit
h the 
resu
lt 
that export markets remain weak
 and turbulent. I firmly believe that not only the Sa
les Department, but also the 
rest 
of 
the 
co
mpany's 
em
ployees 
wi
ll 
be 
able 
to 
succes
sfully 
ov
ercome 
this 
ch
allenge 
by 
w
orking 
efficiently
, 
using 
n
ew 
methods 
of 
work 
organisation 
and 
adopting 
new
 
techn
ologies. 
That 
is 
why 
we 
have 
been, 
are 
and 
will continue to be 
the leaders in
 the Baltic dairy ind
ustry
.

The pro

for

is 
very

requirin

The

to

has also r

As

Sales 
to
 
the US 
increase by 
50% in 
2023 
compared to 
2022, driven 
by
 
a 
significant
 
increase
 
in the 
price 
of 
 
hard 
 
cheese. 
 
 
 
This 
 
is 
 
d
ue 
 
t
o 
 
the 
 
fact 
 
that 
 
annual 
 
sales 
 
co
ntracts 
 
with 
 
s
ome 
 
US 
 
producers 
 
are 
concluded 
i
n 
advanc
e, 
a
nd 
in 
this 
case 
it 
was 
concluded 
at 
a 
time 
of 
high 
chees
e 
prices
. 
This 
is 
the 
reason for the significa
nt increase.
 
Compared 
to 
2022, 
the 
company 
has
 
increased 
butter 
sales 
to 
the 
Middle 
East 
market 
by 
40%. 
T
his 
significant 
increase was
 als
o driven 
by 
the sc
arcity of
 milk
 in th
eir c
ountry
, 
i.e. the
 allocat
ion of 
internal 
resources 
 
was
 
not 
 
s
ufficient 
to 
 
produce 
 
enough
 
mi
lk
 
for 
 
th
e 
 
int
ernal 
butter 
 
production. 
The 
 
pr
ice 
of 
cream, 
when 
converted 
into 
butter
 
per
 
unit 
of
 
fat, 
was 
lower 
than 
before, 
which 
is 
why 
the 
company 
mainly produced bu
tter for the Middle East mark
et instead of sel
ling cream.
 
As 
in 
the 
past, 
the
 
Group 
continued 
t
o 
sell 
its 
usual 
pr
oducts 
- 
crea
m, 
milk 
and 
buttermilk 
flours, 
an
d 
additional produc
ts from the che
ese-
making process
 such as
 WPC
 and lactose
 - 
on export markets.
 In 
the second h
alf of 2023, 
the prices
 of whey 
flour concentrate 
recovered 
strongly
, 
while demand 
for this 
product increased.
 In contras
t, demand for
 lactose fel
l, while supply
 and stocks
 increased, 
leading to a 
significant fall in lactos
e prices.
 
Due 
to 
a 
decr
ease 
in 
demand 
and 
pr
ices 
for 
lactose 
on 
the 
world 
mark
et, 
expor
ts 
of 
lactose 
to
 
India 
have decreased. 
In 20
23, consump
tion/demand s
tarted 
to fall, 
resulting i
n increased 
lactose s
urpluses 
in Europe and the
 
America
s, which further 
pushed the p
rice d
own.

remains 
the

of

into

which is 
currently 
being 
pursued 
intensively 
and is already showing
 good res
ults. The rapidly rising raw materia
l prices dictate that we s

value-added as pos

The

The group's principal 
ac
tivity is milk 
processing. The 
da
iry processing business is l
i
nked to 
raw material 
suppliers, competition in the raw milk mark
et and fluctuations in raw milk prices. Short
ages of raw milk, 
which lead to continu
ous volatility in m
ilk 
prices, may affect the Issuer's res
ults of operations.
 
Specialisation 
in 
the 
production 
of 
fermented 
che
eses 
accounts 
for 
the 
bulk 
of 
revenues. 
The
