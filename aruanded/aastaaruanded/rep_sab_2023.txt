ACCOUNTING P
OLICIES 


The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements a
re set out below.
 


 




Basis of preparation 


 


The financial 
statements of 
the 
Group and
 the Ban
k have 
been prepared in 
accordance with
 International
 Financial 
Reporting Standards
 


as adopted by 
the EU. 
The fin
ancial statements 
have been 
prepared un
der the h
istorical cost c
onvention as 
modified for 
the fa
ir value of
 


financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
fair 
value 
through 
profit 
or 
loss 
and 
investment 
securities 
at 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 


income. 


The 
preparation of 
financial 
statements 
in c
onformity with 
International 
Financial 
Reporting Standards 
require 
the use 
of 
est
imates 
and 


assumptions that affect the rep
orted amounts of 
assets and li
abilities and di
sclosure of contingent assets a
nd liabilities 
at the date 
of the
 


financial 
sta
tements 
and 
t
he 
r
eported 
amounts 
of 
revenues 
a
nd 
expenses 
during 
the 
reporting 
period. 
Although 
these 
e
stimates 
 
are 


based 
on management’s best knowledge of current event and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
 


These financial statements c
ombine the consolidated 
financial statements for the 
Group and separate 
financial statements of t
he Bank. 


Such 
format 
of 
reporting 
was 
adopted 
to 
ensure 
consistency 
of 
presentation 
wit
h 
the 
fo
rmat 
prescribed 
by 
t
he 
Bank 
of 
L
ithuania
 
and 


applied for statutory reporting. 


Neither 
 
the 
 
Bank’s
 
shareholders, 
nor 
any 
other 
 
party 
 
have 
 
power 
 
to
 
amend 
 
the 
 
financial 
 
statem
ents 
after 
issue. 
According 
to 
local 


legislation, the 
financial statements are subject to
 approval in the 
general meeting of sha
reholders, but the approval/disapp
roval cannot 


result in amendment of the financial statements.  


Amounts 
shown 
in 
these 
financia
l 
statements 
are 
presented 
in 
the national 
currency 
the 
euro 
(EUR), 
which 
is 
the 
Bank’s
 
and 
Gro
up‘s 


functional and presentation currency.

it 
 
was 
 
not

ACCOUNTING P

Consolidation of subsidiaries 


Subsidiaries are 
all 
entities (including 
structured 
entities) 
over which 
the Grou
p has 
control. 
The 
Group 
controls an 
entity 
when 
the gr
oup 


is ex
posed to, 
or has 
rights 
to, va
riable returns from 
its 
involvement with 
the 
entity and 
has th
e ability 
to affect 
those 
re
turns through its 


pow
er 
 
over 
 
the
 
 
entity. 
 
Subsidiaries 
 
a
re 
 
fully 
 
consolida
ted 
 
fro
m 
 
the 
 
d
ate 
 
on 
 
which 
 
co
ntrol 
 
is 
 
transferred 
 
to 
 
the 
 
Group. 
 
Th
ey 
 
are 


deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 


Transactions 
with 
n
on-controlling 
interests 
that 
do 
not 
resul
t 
in 
loss 
of 
control
 
are 
accounted 
for 
as 
equity 
transaction
s 
–
 
that 
is, 
as 


transactions 
with 
the owne
rs 
in 
their 
capacity 
as 
owners. 
Th
e 
difference 
between 
fair 
value 
of
 
any 
consideration p
aid 
and 
the
 
releva
nt 


share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subs
idi
ary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling 


interests are also recorded in equity. 


The 
Grou
p 
applies 
the 
acquisition 
method 
to 
account 
for 
business 
combinations. 
The 
consideration 
transferred fo
r 
the 
acquisit
ion 
of a 


subsidiary is the fair values of the assets tra
nsferred, the liabilities incurred to th
e former owners of the acquir
ee and the equity
 interests 


issued 
by 
the 
Group. 
The 
consideration 
transferred 
includes 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
any 
asset 
or 
liabil
ity 
resulting 
from 
a 
co
ntingent 
consideration 


arrangement. 
Identifiable 
assets 
acquired 
and 
liabilities 
and 
co
ntingent 
liabilities 
assumed 
in 
a 
business 
combination 
are 
me
asured 


initially at 
their 
fair 
values at 
the 
acquisition 
date. T
he Group 
recognises 
any 
non
-controlling interest in 
the 
acquiree 
on 
an a
cquisition
-
by
-


acquisition 
basis, 
either 
at 
fair 
v
alue 
or 
at 
the 
non
-
controlling 
i
nterest’s 
proportionate 
share 
of 
the 
recognised 
amounts 
of 
acquiree’s
 


identifiable net assets. 


Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 


If 
the 
business combination 
is 
achieved 
in stages
, the 
acquisition 
date c
arrying v
alue of 
the 
acquirer’s 
previously 
held 
equi
ty interest 
in 


the ac
quiree is 
re-measured 
to fair 
value at 
the acqu
isition date; a
ny gains 
or losses 
arising from 
such 
re
-measurement are
 recognised 


in profit or loss. 


The excess of the 
consideration transferred the 
amount of an
y non
-controlling interest 
in the 
acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value 


of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair va
lue of the iden
tifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  


Where goodwill forms 
part of a
 cash-generating unit and 
part 
of the operation w
ithin that uni
t is di
sposed of, the 
goodwill as
sociated with 


the 
operation 
disposed 
of 
is 
included 
in 
the 
carrying 
amount 
o
f 
the 
operation 
when 
de
termining 
th
e 
gain 
or 
loss 
on 
disposal 
of 
the 


operation. 
Good
will 
disposed 
of 
in 
this 
circumstance 
is 
measured 
based 
on 
the 
relative 
values 
o
f 
the 
operation 
disposed 
of 
an
d 
th
e 


portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 


If 
the 
total 
of 
c
onsideration 
transferred, 
non
-controlling 
interest 
recognised 
and 
previously 
held 
interest 
m
easured 
is 
less 
than 
the 
fair 


value 
of 
the net 
assets 
of 
the s
ubsidiary acquired 
in 
the c
ase of 
a 
bargain 
purchase, 
the difference 
is 
recognised di
rectly i
n

statement.

between 
 
the

(i

Interest income
 and

are 
recognised 
in 
the income 
statement 
on 
debt 
instruments 
at 
amortized 
cost 
or 
at

value 
through 
other 


comprehensive in

a
 
method 
of c
alculating 
the 
amortised 
c
ost 
of 
a 
financial 
asset 
or
 
a 
financial 
liability 
and 
of 
allocating 
th
e 
interest 
income 
or 


interest expense over 
the relevant 
period. The 
effective interest rate
 is 
the rate t
hat exactly d
iscounts estimated future 
ca
sh payments or
 


receipts 
through 
the 
expected 
life 
of 
the 
financial 
instrument 
or, 
when 
appropriate, 
a 
s
horter 
period 
to 
the 
net 
carrying 
amount 
of 
th
e 


financial 
asset 
or 
financial 
li
ability. 
When 
calculating 
t
he 
effective 
interes
t 
rate, 
the 
Group 
e
stimates 
cash 
flows 
consider
ing 
all 
contractual
 


terms 
of 
th
e 
financial 
instrument (for
 
example, 
p
repayment 
o
ptions). 
The 
c
alculation 
includes 
all fee
s 
and 
p
oints 
p
aid 
or 
re
c
eived 
between
 


parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs a
nd all other premiums or discounts. 


Loan origination fees are accounted for as an adjustment to the effective interest ra
te calculation for each issued loan sepa
ra
tely. Other 


commission fees and other similar income and expenses are recognised as gained or
 incurred. 


For financial assets interest income is calculated by applying
 the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount, exce
pt for financial 


assets that are 
credit-impaired (Stage 3)
, for which 
interest income 
is calculated 
by applying 
the effec
tive int
erest rate to 
the net 
carrying 


amount 
(i.e.
 
gross
 
carrying 
amount 
r
educed 
b
y 
the 
allowance 
for 
impairment), 
and 
purchased 
or 
originated 
credit
-impaired 
(POCI) 
assets, 


for which the credit-adjusted effective interest rate is applied to the amortized cost of the financial asset.

The 
recognition 
in 
Income 
st
atem

depends 
on 
whether 
the 
Group's 
obligations 
are 


provided. 
Revenue from 
such s

recognised over 
time on 
a s

the s

provided to 
the customer. 


Revenue 
related

Taxation 


a)
 
 
Income tax 


In 
acc
ordance 
with 
the 
Lithuanian 
Law 
on 
C
orporate 
Profit 
Tax
, 
taxable 
profit
 
for 
2019 
period 
is 
subject 
to 
i
ncome 
tax 
at 
a 
rate 
of 


15%. 
Expenses 
related 
to 
taxation 
charges 
and 
included 
in 
these 
financial 
statements 
are 
b
ased 
on 
calculations 
ma
de 
by 
the 


management 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Lithuanian 
re
gulatory 
le
gislation 
o
n 
ta
xes. 
From 
year 
2
020 
commercial 
banks 
operating 
in
 


Lithuania are be subject to income tax of 20%. 


Deferred income 
tax is provided in full, using
 the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the 
tax bases o
f assets 


and 
liabilities 
and 
their 
carrying 
amounts 
in 
the 
financial 
statements. 
Deferred 
income ta
x 
is 
determined using 
tax 
r
ates 
(and 
laws) 


that 
have 
been 
enacted 
or 
s
ubstantially 
en
acted 
by
 
the 
balance 
sheet 
date 
and 
are 
expected 
t
o 
apply 
when 
the 
related 
d
eferred
 


income 
tax 
asset 
is
 
realised 
or 
the 
deferred 
income 
tax 
liability 
is 
se
ttled 
(20% 
f
or 
deferred 
i
ncome 
tax 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
re
cognized 


at 31 December 2023 and at 31 December 2022
).
 


The principal 
temporary differences arise from 
carry
 forward of 
unused tax losses, 
revaluation of 
securities, difference between 
net
 


book 
value 
and 
tax 
base 
of 
tangible 
fixed 
assets 
and 
accrued 
charges. 
The 
rates e
nacted or 
substant
ively 
enacted 
at 
the 
balan
ce 


sheet date are 
used to determine deferred income tax. However, the 
deferred income tax is no
t
 accounted for if it 
arises from initial 


recognition 
of a
n a
sset or
 
liability 
in 
a 
transaction 
other 
than 
a 
business 
combination 
that 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
transaction 
a
ffects neithe
r 


accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 


Deferred 
tax 
assets 
are 
recognised 
where 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
future 
taxable 
profit 
will 
be 
a
vailable 
against 
which 
the
 
temporary 


differences can be utilised. 


b)
 
 
Other taxes 


Real estate 
tax rate 
is 
up to 
1% on
 the t
ax value
 of 
tangible f
ixed assets 
and forec
losed ass
ets. The 
Bank is 
also obliged to pay 
land 


and 
 
land 
 
lease 
taxes, 
 
make 
 
p
ayments 
 
to 
 
guarantee 
 
fu

security 
 
contributions. 
These 
taxes 
 
are 
 
included 
i

other 


expenses in the income statement.

ACCOUNTING P

Impairment of financial assets 


The 
Group 
assesses 
on 
a
 
forward-looking 
basis 
the 
expected 
c
redit l
osses 
(ECL) 
associated 
with 
its 
debt 
instrument 
assets 
carried 
at 


amortized 
cost 
and 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
an
d 
with 
exposure 
arising 
from 
loan 
commi
tments 
and 
financial 


guarantee c
ontracts. The 
Group recog
nizes a 
loss a
llowance for 
such 
losses at 
each 
reporting date. 
The 
measurement of 
ECL ref
lects 


an 
unbiased 
and 
probability
-weighted 
amount 
that 
is 
determined 
by 
evaluating 
a 
ra
nge 
of possi
ble 
outcomes, 
the 
time 
value 
of 
money 


and reasonable 
and supportab
le information t
hat is 
available 
without undue 
cost or 
effort at 
the rep
orting date 
about past 
ev
ents, current 


conditions and 
forecasts of fut
ure economic condition. 
Section 
1.3 of th
e Financial ri
sk man
agement disclosure pro
vides more 
details on 


the ECL measurement. 








Derecognition of financial assets 


The Group derecognises a financial a
sset when the contract
ual rights to 
the cash flows from 
the financial asset e
xpire, or it transfers t
he 


rights to 
receive 
the c
ontractual 
cash flows in 
a 
transaction 
in 
which substantially 
all 
risks 
and 
rewards of 
ownership 
of t
he f
inancial as
set 


are 
transferred 
or 
in 
which the 
Grou
p 
neither 
transfers 
nor 
retains 
substantiall
y 
all 
of 
risks 
a
nd 
rewards 
o
f 
ownership 
and 
it does 
no
t 
retain
 


control of the financial asset. On derecognition of a financial asset
 the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the date of 


derecognition) 
and 
the 
consideration 
received 
(including 
any 
n
ew 
asset 
obtained 
less 
any 
new 
liability 
assumed)
 
and 
any 
cumulative 


gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recog
nised in profit or loss. 








Write-offs of financial assets 


Loans 
an
d 
receivables 
 
are 
regularly 
reviewed 
and 
written-off 
from 
the 
balance 
sh
eet 
when 
the 
total 
loan 
ba
lance 
or 
a 
part 
of 
i
t 
is
 


considered as un
collectible under the most 
optimistic scenario using expert judgement on
 each exposure. 
Typically, the judgem
ent that 


there is 
no r
easonable expectation for 
recovery is a
pplied for the 
exposures where 
there are no 
clear i
ndications of possible 
cash flows 


from the borrower and to the exten
t that the collateral is deemed insufficient. 100% impairment provision against the carryin
g amount of 


the exposure must be recognized before an uncollectible exposure (or part of it that is considered to be uncollectible) can b
e written-off.
 


Written-off 
exposures are a
ccounted for as 
off
-
balance sheet 
claims (“accumulated 
write
-
offs”) 
until 
the legal 
right 
to claim 
the amounts 


from the borrower expires. 








Modifications of financial assets 


The Ban
k sometimes mo
difies the payment 
terms of 
loans to 
customers due
 to comme
rcial renegotiations, or fo
r distressed l
oans
, with 


a 
view 
to 
maximising 
recovery. 
Modification 
practices 
are 
based 
on 
criteria

in
 
the 
ju
dgement 
of

continue.

On

recalculated 
as 
the

Impairment of non-financial assets 


Assets 
 
are 
 
revie
wed 
 
for 
 
impairment 
 
whe
never 
 
events 
 
or 
 
chang
es

circumstances 
 
i
ndicate 
 
that 
 
the 
 
c
arrying 
 
amount 
 
may 
 
not 
 
b
e 


recoverable. 
Goodwill 
is 
tested for 
impairment at 
lea
st 
annually. 
An impai
rment l
oss 
is 
recognised 
for 
the 
amo
unt 
by 
which 
the asset’s 


carrying 
amount 
exceeds 
its 
recoverable 
amount. 
The 
re
coverable 
amount 
is 
the 
higher 
of 
an 
asset’s 
fair 
value 
l
ess 
costs 
to 
s
e
ll 
a
nd 


value 
in 
use. For 
the 
purposes 
of 
assessing 
impairment, 
assets 
are 
grouped 
at 
the 
l
owest 
levels 
for wh
ich 
there 
are 
separately 
identifiable 


cash 
inflows 
(cash-generating 
units). 
The 
impairment 
test 
also 
can 
be 
performed 
on 
a 
single 
asset 
when 
the 
fair v

Non-financial 
asse
ts 
other 
than 
g
oodwill 
that 
suffered 
impairment 
are 
reviewed 
for 
possible 


reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 








Reverse repurchase transactions 


Securities purchased under agreements to 
resell (“reverse 
repos”) are recorded as loan
s and advances to oth
er banks or custom
ers, a
s 


appropriate. The 
difference between 
purchase and repu
rchase price i
s treated as
 interest and 
accrued over th
e life 
of agree

the 
effective 
interest 
method. Securities 
borrowed 
are 
not 
recognised in
 the 
financial 
statements, 
unless th
ese a
re sold 
to 
t
hird 
parties, 


in which case the purchase and sale are recorded with the gain or loss included in tra
ding income. 
 


Reverse repurchase agreements are classified as loans and receivables and are accounted for using the amortised cost 
method.

contracts 
groups. 
The 
Group
 
and the 
Com
pany 
have 
d
ecide
d 
not 
to
 
distribute 
the 
i
nsurance 
finance 
incom
e 
and 
expenses 
between 
profit 


and loss and other comprehensive income statements. 


In 
accordance 
with 
IFRS 
17, 
th
e 
Company 
groups 
the 
insuran
ce 
contracts 
into 
so-called units 
of 
acco
unts. 
The 
pur
pose 
of 
such 
grouping 


is 
to 
ensure 
that 
pro
fit 
would 
be 
recognised 
over 
time 
proportionally 
to 
the 
insurance 
service 
provided 
while 
losses 
are 
reco
gnised 


immediately 
when 
the 
Company 
assesses 
that 
the 
contract 
is 
generating 
loss. 
Setting 
off 
p
rofit 
and 
loss 
between 
d
ifferent 
insurance
 


contracts groups is not allowed. Insurance contracts are aggregated into insurance contra
cts groups based on such three level
s:  


1.
 
 
Portfolio 
–
 similar risk contracts managed together. 


2.
 
 
Profitability 
–
 contracts of same profitability. 


It was decide
d to di
vide a 
portfolio of i
nsurance contracts 
issued in
to onerous 
and remaining
, where onerous

overs ins
u
rance 


contracts 
 
that 
 
at 
 
initial 
 
recognition 
 
have 
 
been 
 
estimated

The 
 
insurance 
 
contract 
 
is 
 
es
timated 
 
wit

of profitability is done. 


3.
 
 
Cohort 
–
 contracts which date of entry into force differ by more than one year.  


Portfolio cohort 
period 
beginni
ng is 
January 
1st 
of 
each 
calendar 
year an
d co
ntracts of 
each

are 
accounted 
using 
a

(annual 
 
cohort).

co
ntracts

December 
 
2023
 
 
were 
 
recognized 
 
at 


acquisition date and were group into 2023-year coho
rt. 


The Company has chosen to apply two of the models defined in IFRS 17 for evaluating the insurance contra
cts: 
 


•
 
 
General Measurement Model, GMM, is applied to insurance 
contracts that insures 
certain risk over the longer period of time. 


•
 
 
Variable Fee Approach, VFA, is applied to insurance contracts with in
vestment components and fulfilling the definition of con
tracts
 


with direct participation feature. 


According 
to 
IFRS
 
17, 
the
 
ca
rrying 
val
ue 
of 
a 
gro
up 
of 
insurance 
contracts 
a
t 
end 
of 
each 
reporting 
period 
is 
calculated
 
by 
ad
ding 
the 


liability 
for 
remaining 
coverage 
and 
the 
liability 
for 
incurred c
laims.  
When
 
evaluating 
these 
liabilities, 
the 
risk
-adjusted present 
value 
of 


future c
ash-flows 
(hereinafter 
- fu
lfilment cashflo
ws) is 
estimate 
for e
ach unit 
of 
account, 
separately evaluating 
the 
present v
alue of 
the 


future cash-flows and risk adjustment for non-financial risks.  


For unit of accounts without loss component, the liability f
or rem
aining coverage consists of fulfilment cashflows and contractual service 


margin.  
At 
initial 
recognition, 
the 
contractual 
service 
margin 
is 
equal to 
s
uch 
amount 
which r
esults i
n total 
liability 
for 
remaining 
coverage
 


equal 
to 
0. 
In 
case, 
the 
contractual 
service 
margin 
at 
initial 
recognition 
is 
negative, 
the 
contractual 
service 
margin 
is 
zeroized 
and 
the 


corresponding negative value is recognized as loss component which directly impa
cts profit or loss. 
 


For 
 
evaluation 
 
of 
 
the 
 
liability 
fo
r 
remaining 
coverage
, 
 
the 
 
future 
 
cashflows 
 
of 
 
i
nsurance 
co
ntracts 
are 
modelled 
 
within 
the 
 
contract 


boundary. 
Due 
to 
long te
rm 
insurance 
and 
the 
li
mited 
ability to
 
reassess 
portfolio 
risk
, 
the 
contract 
boundary 
is 
th
e 
same 
as
 
contracts’
 


maturity date. When evaluating 
the unit of account liabilities, the Company ta
kes into account 
all future cashflows wit
hin the boundary 
of 


insurance contracts.

ACCOUNTING P
OLICIES
 (CONTIN
UED) 




Insurance 
acquisition 
cashflows 
is 
a 
se
parate 
cost 
category 
which 
is 
considered 
when
 
eval
uating 
the 
insurance 
li
ability 
of 
re
maining 


co
verage. 
Such 
cashflows 
include cashflows 
arising 
from 
insurance 
contracts 
group a
cquisition, 
distribution 
and 
commencement c
o
sts
 


directly 
attributable 
to 
portfolio 
o
f 
insurance 
contracts 
to 
which 
that 
group 
belongs. 
When 
applying 
GMM 
and 
VFA 
meth
ods, 
fut
ur
e 


expected attributable c
osts are affe
cting the amount 
of CSM 
and ar
e recognized i
n profit (lo
ss) during th
e remaining 
insuranc
e
 
coverage 


according to the respective coverage units. 


For 
the 
estimation 
of
 
the 
present 
va
lue 
o
f 
the 
e
xpected 
futu
re 
cashflows, 
the 
Co
mpany 
has 
d
ecided 
to 
use
 
discount 
rates 
de
rived 
by
 


applying 
the 
bottom-up 
approach 
(described 
 
as 
 
a 
combination 
o
f 
risk-free 
curve 
and 
the 
liquidity 
premium). 
Fo
r 
the 
d
iscounting 
of 


cashflows, 
the 
Company 
has 
 
decided 
 
to 
use 
the 
risk

terest 
rate 
c
urves 
published 
 
by 
 
European 
 
Insurance 
and 
Occ
upationa
l 


Pensions 
Authority (EIOPA). 
For the 
purpose 
to reflec
t the 
liquidity c
haracteristics of 
the cashflows, 
for u
nit
-linked 
products, th
e EIOPA 


risk-free interest rate without volatility adjustment i
s use
d, and for other products, a
s they are considered less liq
uid, the EIOPA risk
-fre
e 


rate with volatility adjustment is used.  


When 
applying 
GMM, 
the 
discount 
curves 
locked
-in 
at 
initial 
recognition 
are 
used. 
As 
new 
c
ontracts 
start 
uniformly 
ov
er 
the 
year, 
t
he 


weighted 
average 
discount 
curve 
is 
locked
-in 
which 
is 
derived 
by 
using 
end 
of 
each 
quarter/month 
risk-free 
rates 
and 
the 
contracts 


issued/written premiums during the respective period. 


When 
evaluating 
the 
insurance 
contract 
liabilities, 
the 
Company 
includes 
the 
risk 
adjust
ment 
for 
non
-financial 
risk 
which 
is 
estimated 


separately from the expected future c
ashflows and defined as the compensation an en
tity requires for bearing the uncertainty 
about the 


amount and timing o
f the cash flows that arises from non
-financial risk as the Company fulfils insurance contracts. The
 Company chose
 


to calculate risk 
adjustment ba
sed on Solvenc
y II 
capital requirement before 
diversification. 
Assumption is 
made that al
l Sol
vency II non-


financial 
risk 
(mortality, 
longevity, 
di
sability, 
validity, 
outflows an
d c
atastrophe 
risk) 
is 
distributed 
by 
normal
 
distribut
ion. The 
calculat
ion 


of 
the 
risk 
adjustment 
is 
based 
on 
determining 
the 
risks 
at 
the 
reference 
date 
(t=0) 
and 
forecasting
 
them 
based 
on 
a 
run
-off 
pattern 


appropriate 
for 
each 
non

risk 
based 
on
 
C
overage 
units. 
Based 
on the 
d
ecision 
of 
th
e 
Company, 
the 
risk adjustmen
t 
corresponds 


to 
a 
75% 
confidence 
level 
of 
the

The

traditional lending and 
treasury segments suc

as 
lending 
to
 
subsidiaries 
(except

to 
l

and 
consumer 
financing 
subsidiaries), 
rev
enues/expenses 
rel

to 


investment 
in 
subsidiaries 
(dividends, 
impairment 
of

i
n 
one

managing 


problem loans (includes financial information of the Bank allocated to this segment); 


•
 
 
Other 
activities 
–
 
includes 
other

performed 
by 
Gro

in 
previous 
segments 
–
 
i.e. 
real 
estate 


operations, life insurance, investment management (includes financial information of the subsi
di
aries not mentioned above). 


As the 
Group’s 
segment 
operations, 
except 
for rea
l e
state de
velopment are 
all 
financial 
with 
a 
majority 
of re
venues d
eriving 
from interest 


and 
the 
Group 
Executive 
Bo
ard 
relies 
primarily 
on 
net 
inter
est 
rev
enue
 
to 
assess 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
segment, 
the 
total 
interest 


income 
and 
expense 
for 
all 
reportable 
segments 
is 
presented 
on 
a
 
net 
basis. 
Also 
all 
other 
main 
items 
of 
the 
income 
statement
 
are
 


analysed by the management of the Group on segment basis therefore they are presented in the segment reporting. 


Transactions 
between 
the business 
segments 
are 
carried 
out at 
arm
’s l
ength. The 
revenue 
from 
external 
parties repo
rted to 
the
 
Group 


Executive 
Board 
is 
measured 
in 
a 
ma
nner 
consistent 
with 
that 
in 
the 
consolid

Funds 
are 
or
dinarily 
allocated 


between segments, resulting i
n funding cost transfers disclosed in
 inter
-segment net interest income. Intere
st charged for these funds i
s 


based on the Group’s cost of capital. There are no other materia
l items of income or expense between the business segments. 


The 
Group’s 
management 
rep

is 
based 
o
n 
a

income, loan impairment charges, operating expenses, amortizatio
n and depreciation expenses and other net income. 


As 
the 
Group focuses 
on 
domestic 
activities, no 
geographical 
concentration is 
observed 
in 
Group‘s decision
 making. 
Due 
to 
the
 nature 


of Group‘s ac
tivities (financial services), capital 
expenditures are not
 important 
in the decision making process 
therefore not used in the 


segment reporting and total assets is more relevant indicator 
than the fixed asset amount.
 








Fiduciary activities 


Assets 
and

such 
assets 
to 
customers 
are 
excluded 
from 
these 


financial statements where the Group acts in a fiduciary capacity such as nominee, trustee 
or agent. 
 








Fair value of assets and liabilities 


Fair 
value 
represents 
the 
price 
that 
would 
be 
received 
to 
sell 
an 
asset 
or

Financial guarantee contracts, letters of credit and undrawn loan commitments 


Financial guarantee 
c

are c
ontracts 
that require 
the

to 
make 
specified

ACCOUNTING P
OLICIES
 (CONTIN
UED) 




Share issue costs 


Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the p
roceeds. 








Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale 


Non-current 
assets 
(or 
disposal 
groups) 
are classified 
as 
assets 
held 
for 
sale 
when 
their carry
ing amoun
t is 
to 
be 
recovered 
principally 


through a 
sale transaction and 
a sale 
is considered highly
 probable. They a
re stated at 
the lower 
of carrying amount 
and fair
 
value les
s 


costs to sell. 








Investment properties 


Properties 
that 
are 
held 
for 
long
-term 
rental 
yields 
or 
for 
capital 
appreciation 
or 
both, 
and 
that 
are 
not 
occupied 
by 
the 
entities 
in 
the
 


consolidated group, are classified as investment properties. Investment proper
ties comprise buildings for commercial activities and land 


plots for undetermined future use. 


Some p
roperties may be 
partially occupied by 
the Group, 
with the 
remainder being held 
for rental 
income or ca
pital appreciati
on. If 
that 


part 
o
f 
the 
p
roperty 
occu
pied b
y 
the 
Group ca
n 
be 
sold 
sep
arately, 
the 
Group 
accounts 
for 
th
e 
portions 
separately. 
The po
rtion 
that 
is 


owner-occupied is accounted for under IAS 16, and the portion th
at is held for rental income or capital appreciation or both is tre
ated as 


investment 
pro
perty 
under 
IAS 
40. 
When 
the 
portions 
cannot 
be 
sold 
s
eparately, 
the 
whole 
property 
is 
treated 
as 
investment 
p
roperty 


only if 
an insignificant 
portion is owner
-occupied. 
The Group conside
rs the owner
-occupied portion 
as insignificant 
when the proper
ty 
is 


more than 
95% held 
to earn 
rental income o
r capital appreciation. 
In order to 
determine the percentage 
of the p
ortions, the G
roup u
ses 


the size of the property measured in square meters. 


Recognition of 
investment properties takes 
place only 
when it i
s probable that 
the future economic 
benefits that are 
associated with the 


investment property will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably. This is usu
ally the day when all risks are
 
transferred. 


Investment properties 
are 
measured 
initially at 
cost, 
including 
transaction c
osts. Th
e carrying 
amount 
includes 
the 
cost 
of r
eplacing part
s 


of 
an existing 
investment 
property at 
the 
time the 
cost 
has incurre
d if 
the 
recognition criteria 
are 
met; and 
excludes 
the 
co
sts of 
day-
to
-


day servicing of an investment property. Subsequent t
o initial recognition, investment pr
operties are measured at cost
 less accumulated
 


depreciation. 
Depreciation is
 provided 
on 
a 
straight
-line 
basis to
 write
 off 
proportionally 
the co
st of 
each 
asset 
over 
its e
stimated 
usefu
l
 


life. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to t
he income statement during the financial period in which they a
re
 incurred. 


In addition, investment properties are te
sted for impairment. 
These valuations are performe
d annually by external or 
internal appraisers. 








Derivative financial instruments 


Derivatives 
 
are 
 
initially 
 
recognised 
 
at 
 
fa
ir 
 
value 
 
on 
 
the 
 
date 
 
on 
 
which 
 
a 
 
derivative 
 
c
ontract 
 
is 
 
entered 
 
into 
 
and 
 
are 
 
subsequ
ently 


remeasured 
at 
their fair 
value. 
Fair 
values a
re obtained 
from qu
oted m
a
rket prices
 in 
active 
markets (fo
r example, 
for 
exchange
-traded 


options), including recent 
market transactions, an
d valuation techniques (for 
example for 
non
-traded options), including di
scounted cash
 


flow models and op
tions pricing models, as appropriate.
 All derivatives are ca
rried as assets when fair value is positive 
and as liabilities 


when fair value is negative. All derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trad
ing.

Strategy in using financial instruments 


The

these 
margins 
by 
c

idating 


short-term funds and lending for longer
 periods at higher rates whilst 
maintaining sufficient liqui

 might fall due.   


Strategic d
ecisions related to 
financing and
 investing activities of 
the 
Bank and 
the Group 
is made by 
the Board 
of the 
Bank.
 
Operating 


financing and inves

on division level. Divisions of 
the Group are pres
ented in Segment informati

on risk management are made by the Risk Management Committee of the Bank.  


The Bank and the Group also seeks to raise its interest 
margins by obtaining above average margins, net of provisions,

by 
the

to 
man

different 
types 
of 
risks 


prepared on its basis ensures the integrity of the risk management process in the Group. 


The purpose of risk management poli
cy is to define the risks as well 
as their management principles in t
he Group’s activities
. Due to the 


fact 
that 
various 
risks experienced 
by 
the 
Group 
are 
interdependent their 
management 
is 
centralized. 
Organization and
 coordi
n
ation of 


the experienced risk management system is one of the main goals of the Bank’
s Risk Management Committee.
 


The Group reviews its 
risk management 
procedures and s
ystems to reflect 
changes in 
markets, products an
d emerging best pra
ctice on 


regular basis, at least annually.  


The Group performs sel
f assessment each year. This process analyses 
types of risks that could potentially 
a
rise from banking activities
 


and have 
material 
impact 
to 
the 
Group. Th
e most 
important 
types 
of 
risk t
he G
roup 
is expos
ed to 
are 
credit 
risk, 
market ri

liquidity 
risk,
 


concentration risk, 
operational 
ri

risk, 
model 
risk, 
compliance r
isk 
and ESG 
ri
sk. 
Market 
risk 
includes currency 
risk, 
interest 
rate 
and 


securities price risk. Other types of risk are considered immaterial by the Group and, t
herefore, are not assessed. 
 


In 
 
order

focused on 
small and

with the 
better

With respect to provision of

1.1. Credit risk measurement 


 


(a) Loans and receivables 


 


The Bank applies credit risk management measures, which could be divided into two types: 


1)
 
 
Measures that help to avoid decisions to grant loans with higher risk potential; 


2)
 
 
Measures ensuring the effective monitoring system of the Ba
nk’s asset quality.
 


 


Measures that help to avoid decisions to grant loans with higher risk potential: 


1)
 
 
Multi-stage decision-making and its approval system; 


2)
 
 
Defined credit risk appetite, credit risk indicators and risk allocation among structural levels 
–
 limit establishment;  


3)
 
 
Customer risk assessment requirements set by internal procedures; 


4)
 
 
Credit standards and acceptable credit risk criteria for separate products; 


5)
 
 
Security measures f
or credit repayment (collateral). 


Multi-stage decision-making and its approval system has an 
aim not to make one-man decisions regarding credit gr
anting by authorized
 


persons 
but 
to
 
make 
them 
be 
discussed by
 
the 
collegial 
bodies 
of the 
Ba
nk 
and, 
as 
th
e 
case 
may 
be, 
by th
e 
Bank’s 
Loan 
Committ
ee, 


the Bank’s Board or Council. There are certain limits to authorized persons establi

It is very important to precisely analy
se all the information about the 
customer before granting 
the credit. The goal of credit analy
sis is to
 


do 
the 
best 
in
 
ev

the 
customer’s 
 
creditworthiness, 
status 
and 
prospects 
in 
the 
field 
where 
he/she 
provides 
h
is/her 
g

or 


services. 
 
Every 
credit 
 
decision 
is 
 
based 
 
on 
 
the 
 
adequate 
assessment 
of 
c

repayment 
possibilities

oan 


portfolio. These procedures include the criteria for early indication of potentia
lly impaired loans and other transactions.
 


 


(b) Debt securities 


 


Credit risk exposures with respect to
 debt securities are managed by carrying out counterparty analysis when decisi
on for acquisition of 


securities is 
made. 
The 
conce
ntration ri
sk together 
with 
lending 
exposure 
arising 
from 
debt 
s
ecurities 
portfolio 
is 
analysed 
and monitored
 


on a regular basis by the Risk Management Committee of the Bank. 


 


(c) Credit-related commitments 


 


Other 
c
redit-related 
commitments 
assumed 
by 
the 
Group 
incl
ude 
guarantees, 
letters 
of 
documentary 
credit, 
commitments 
to 
grant 
a
 


credit 
which 
expose 
the 
Group 
to 
the 
same 
credit 
risk 
as 
the 
loans 
do. 
The 
key 
aim 
of 
these 
instruments 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
fun
ds 
are 


available to 
a customer as 
required. The above gu
arantees and letters 
of documentary credit are 
usually collateralised by c
li
ents’ funds 


in 
the 
Bank 
accounts. 
 
With
 
regards 
to 
c
ommitments 
to 
grant 
c
redit th
e 
Bank 
is 
exposed 
to 
loss equal 
to 
t
he 
unus
ed co
mmitment 
amount.

Control of risk limits and risk mitigation policy
 


 


(a) Concentrations 


 


The 
 
Group 
 
m
anages, 
limits 
 
and 
 
controls 
 
concentration 
 
of 
credit 
 
risk 
 
–
 
 
in 
 
particu
lar, 
to 
 
individual 
 
counterparties 
 
an
d 
groups 
 
of 
 
the 


associated counterparties as well as to economic sectors. 


In 
addition 
to 
the 
supervisory requirements 
t
o 
limit 
the 
e
xposures 
to 
a 
single borrower 
a
nd 
large 
exposures, 
the Group 
al
so 
s
ets e
xposure 


requirement, 
which to 
a 
sin
gle 
borrower 
may not 
exceed 
15 perc
ent of 
the 
Bank’s capital. 
The 
Bank’s 
Council must 
approve 
the higher 


limits. Prudential 
maximum 
exposure requ
irement to 
a 
single 
borrower is 
25 p
ercent. Con
centration of 
credit 
risk of 
t
he Ba
nk 
is
 
disclosed 


in Section 1.8. of Financial Risk Management disclosure. 


The Group a
lso sets 
limits to 
industry 
segments, i.e.
 a 
possible concentration
 in cer
tain industries a
t the 
Group’s leve
l is 
restricted by 
the 


internal lending limits. Th
e percentage and 
volume of lending
 limits are
 
set for individual 
industries to ensure that 
the Group 
is not overl
y 


exposed to any particular economic sector in the country.  


The 
geographical concentration 
risk is
 not 
recognised i
n the 
Group’s 
business since 
the 
principle of 
focusing 
on domestic 
cu
stomers is 


followed. 


Some other specific control and mitigation measures are outlined below. 


b) Collateral 


 


The 
Group 
mitigates 
credit 
 
risk 
by 
taking 
s
ecurity 
for 
loa
ns 
gra
nted. 
The 
types
 
of 
 
collateral 
considered 
 
by 
the 
 
Group 
a
s 
the 
 
most 


acceptable for loans and advances are the following: 


•
 
 
Real estate (mainly residential properties, commercial and industrial real estate); 


•
 
 
Business assets (equipment, inventory, transport vehicles); 


•
 
 
Property rights over financial instruments (debt securities, equities); 


•
 
 
Third party guarantees. 


Long
-term f
inancing 
and 
lending to 
corporate 
entities 
are 
ge
nerally 
secured; revolving 
facili
ties and 
consumer 
loans 
to 
private 
in
dividuals
 


are generally unsecured. In order to minimize the credit lo
ss as the impairment
 indicators for the relevant individual loan
s and advances 


are noticed the Group seeks for additional collateral from the counterparty. 


While 
calculating 
a 
decrease 
in 
value 
for 
the 
loan 
the 
repayment 
of 
which 
is 
secured 
by 
the 
collateral, 
a 
cash 
flow 
from
 
th
e 
security 


measure is also 
taken into consideration when determining the LGD factor. If s
everal loans are insured with 
the same security
 measure 


(collateral), such security measure (collateral) is allocated ac
cording to rank of the pledge.
 


Debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills are generally unsecured. 


For 
finance 
lease 
receivables 
the 
lende
r remains 
t
he 
owner 
of 
the 
leased 
object. 
T
herefore, 
in 
case 
of 
customer’s 
default 
the
 
lender 
is 


able to gain control on the risk mitigation measures and 
realize them in rather short period.

1.3. Impairment and provisioning policies 


 


a) ECL model used by the Group 


 


Upon 
 
assessing 
 
impairment 
 
losses 
 
on 
 
l
oans, 
 
due 
 
to 
 
b
anks, 
 
debt 
 
securities 
 
at 
 
amortized 
 
cost 
 
and 
 
at 
 
fair 
 
value 
 
through 
 
other 


comprehensive 
income 
and 
other 
ass
ets 
the 
Group 
follows 
the 
requirements 
expected 
credit 
lo
ss 
(ECL) 
model 
prescribed 
in 
IFRS 
 
9 


Financial Instruments. The 
Group and 
the B
ank carries 
out valuation 
of asset
s on a 
monthly ba
sis, based o
n valuation 
policies 
appro
v
ed
 


by the Board of the Bank.  


 


The ECL is measured by the formula: 


 


PD x LGD x EAD = ECL 


Where: 


PD 
–
 probability of default. It represents the likelihood of a borrower on defaulting on its financial obligation; 


LGD 
–
 loss given default. It represents the extent of loss the Group is likely to incur in case 
the borrower defaults;
 


EAD 
–
 exposure at default. It represents expected exposure at the time of the default. 


The financial assets are grouped into 3 stages: 


 


1)
 
 
Stage 1 financial assets 
–
 no significant increase in credit risk is observed since initi
al recognition. The Group uses low credit 


risk exemption and assigns all of the exposures with external investment grade credit rating 
or exposures with Standard 


internal credit rating to Stage 1. 12 months 
PDs apply to Stag
e 1 exposures; 


2)
 
 
Stage 2 financial assets 
–
 significant increase in credit risk is observed since initial recognition. The Group uses multiple 


criteria to assess whether the credit risk has increased. Main criteria include: cr
edit rating decrease
, 
payment delays, other 


observable criteria (restructuring, forbearance, inclusion in 
Watch List
). Lifetime PDs apply to Stage 2 exposures; 


3)
 
 
Stage 3 financial assets 
–
 credit-impaired financial assets. Main criteria for inclusion the asset in Stage 3 include: bankruptcy 


of the customer; termination of the contract; payment delay >90 days; non
-performing exposure status by regulatory rules (i.e. 


the exposure is unlikely to be repaid in full without collateral realisation (irrespe
ctive of any past
-due amount or of the number 


of days past-due)); other observable criteria. For Stage 3 exposures, the PD ratio is a
lways equal to 1. Minimal provisions are 


also calculated in accordance to regulatory requirements for older non
-performing loans. 


 


In 
case 
observable 
evidence 
is 
available, 
Group’s 
employees 
responsible 
for 
impairment 
calculations 
can 
rank
 
certain 
exposure
s 
to
 


better or worse stage.  


The 
exposure 
c
eases 
to 
be 
Stage 
3 
whe
n 
it 
no 
longer 
meets 
th
e 
cri
teria 
for 
the 
consecutive 
per
iod 
of 
at 
least 
3 
m
onths. 
It
 
sh
ould 
b
e 


noted 
that 
some 
of 
the re
gulatory no
n-performing 
exposure cri
teria have 
their 
own 
exit 
periods
, 
therefore 
the 
period 
for 
an e
xposure 
to
 


be classified out of Stage 3 may actually be longer. 


The 
Group c
alculates 
its 
own 
PDs 
for 
loans 
to 
c
ustomers, 
finance 
lease 
receivables 
and 
oth
er 
assets 
and 
uses 
PDs 
published 
by
 
th
e 


rating agencies for debt securities and due to banks. 


PDs 
for 
loans 
to customers 
and 
finance 
lease 
receivables are 
calculated 
using 
the historical 
data 
of 
Group’s own 
lending 
port
folio. 
Full 


approach is

d for
 fin
ance 
lease re
ceivables a
s fi
nancial 
leases 
are 
part o
f G
roup’s 
main 
a
ctivities. For 
this 
purpose, 
t
he Group 
uses
 


migration 
matrices 
for 
th
e 
exposures 
grouped 
by 
the 
economic 
sector. 
The 
Group 
uses 
PDs 
published 
by
 
rating 
agencies 
for 
debt
 


securities and due from banks. For other financial assets, a si
mplified model derived 
from Group’s lending data is used.
 


For loans 
to customers and finance lease receivables, 
LGDs are estimated by the Group 
using the value of c
ollateral available
 for each 


exposure 
in
dividually 
and 
disc
ounting 
by 
certain 
ratios 
over c
ertain 
pe
riod

me. 
R
atios 
and 
recovery

depen
d 
on
 
the 
type 
of 


collateral 
and 
are 
de
rived 
from 
Group’s 
own 
recovery 
experience. 
For 
consumer 
financing 
exposures, 
the 
LGDs 
are 
estima
ted 
on 
 
a 


exposure group 
level 
using 
the 
ultimate reco
very rate 
historic
al data. 
For 
debt securities and
 
due from 
banks, 
LGDs 
from 
rating a
gencies 


are used.  


For lending portfol
io, Stage 
1 EAD 
represents the 
expected exposure 
value over 
12 month
 period and 
assumptions on t
he expecte
d use 


of 
th
e 
off-balance 
s
heet

Stage 
2 
 
EAD 
 
rep
resents 
the

value 
over 
the

f 
the

and 


assumptions 
on 
the 
expected u
se 
of 
the o
ff-b

Stage 
3 
EAD 
is 
estimated 
as 
the 
total 
balance 
and 
off
-


balance sheet exposure. For debt securities, due from banks and other assets, gross exposure value is used as EAD estimate.

a) Credit grades 


 


The 
Group and 
the Bank 
examines the 
potential borrower’s 
financial 
performance before issuing 
a 
loan and m
onitors any 
develop
m
ent 


in 
financial performance 
during the 
whole l
oan service 
period. The 
Group 
and 
the Bank 
evaluates the 
borrower’s financial 
perf
ormance 


at 
least 
annually. 
Consumer 
loans 
to 
individuals 
are
 
assessed 
based 
on 
application 
scorings 
when 
decision 
is 
made. 
Afte
r 
they
 
are 


granted they are monitored based on their past due status.  


The 
Bank 
uses 
internal 
grade 
system 
that 
has 
11 
internal 
gr
ades 
(1 
–
 
best, 
11 
–
 
worst). 
During 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2021, 
internal 
credit 


rating 
 
procedures 
were 
 
enhanced: 
an 
updated 
legal 
customer 
 
financial 
status 
 
methodology 
 
was 
 
implemented. 
 
Main 
change 
 
in 
 
the 


methodology 
–
 
increased 
number 
of 
grades: 
the
re 
were 
5 
internal 
grades 
under 
previous 
methodology, 
updated 
methodology 
has 
11
 


grades. This allows for m
ore granular assessment of borrowers. Cle
ar links between internal credit grades and cred
it stages h
ave been 


established 
–
 exposures assi
gned to 
internal credit rating gra
des 7 
–
 9 
are in cr
edit stage 2, 
exposures assigned 
internal grades 
10 
–

d) Information about loan collateral  


 


The method 
for collateral
 valuation 
is selected 
by t
he Group 
and the B
ank ba
sed on 
specifics of 
collateral 
and existing 
marke
t 
condition
s 


on 
th
e 
day 
of 
valuation. 
Based 
on 
collateral 
characteristics 
an
d 
the
 
purpose 
of 
its 
valuatio
n 
the
 
following
 
valuation 
meth
ods
 
are 
used: 


comparable 
sales price 
method 
or 
income 
capitalisation 
method. 
Fair 
values 
of 
the 
collateral 
are 
updated 
regu
larly in 
line 
with 
the 
Bank’s 


procedures. 


If loan 
is secured by several 
different types of collateral, priority in 
their recognition is 
based on their liquidity. Cash 
deposits are treated 


as 
having 
the
 h
ighest 
liquidity 
followed 
by 
gu
arantees, 
resid
ential 
real 
estate 
and then 
o
ther real
 
estate. 
Securities 
that 
have
 no
 
active 


market and other assets are treated as having the lowest liquidity. 


Unsecured 
loans 
also 
i
nclude 
loans 
secured 
by 
other 
types 
of 
collateral 
(e.g. 
future 
inflow 
of 
fund
s 
i
nto
 
the 
b
orrowers’ 
Bank 
accounts 


(controlled by 
the 
Bank), 
third party 
warrantees,

change, etc.).

d) Information about risk mitigation measures for finance lease receivables  


 


Upon 
initial 
 
recognition 
 
of 
 
financial 
l
ease 
receivables, 
the 
fair 
 
value 
 
of 
 
risk 
 
m
itigation 
measures 
is 
 
based 
 
on 
 
valuation 
 
app
roaches 


commonly 
used 
for 
the 
corresponding 
ty
pes 
of 
 
assets. 
Market 
values 
are 
used 
for 
real 
estate 
a
nd 
movable 
assets 
serving 
as
 
risk 


mitigation measures. In subsequent periods, the fair value of
 risk mitigation measures is updated based on their depreciation
 rates. 


If 
ex
posure 
is 
s
ecured 
by 
severa
l 
differe
nt 
types 
of 
risk 
mitigation 
m
easures, 
priority 
in 
their 
recognition 
is 
based 
on 
their 
 
liquidity. 


Transport 
vehicles 
are
 
treated 
as 
having
 
highest 
liquidity 
followed 
by 
residential real 
e
state a
nd 
then 
othe
r 
real 
estate. 
Eq
uipment 
an
d 


other assets are treated as having lowest liquidity. 


The lender 
remains the owner of the 
leased object. Therefore, in c
ase of customer 
default it is able to 
gain control on 
the r
isk mitigation 


measures and realize them in rather short period. 


Following tables present the lower of lease receivable and collateral amount per agreement.

2. MARKET RISK
 


 


The 
Group 
takes 
on 
e
xposure 
to 
ma
rket risk, 
which means 
the 
risk 
f
or 
the 
Group 
to 
i
ncur losses
 
due 
to 
the 
adverse 
fluctuation
s 
in 
the
 


market 
 
parameters 
 
such 
 
as 
 
curre
ncy 
 
exchange 
 
rates 
 
(foreign 
 
currency 
 
risk), 
 
interest 
 
rates 
 
(interest 
 
rate 
 
risk) 
 
or 
 
secur
ities 
 
prices 


(securities risk). S
ecurities and 
interest rate 
risks ar
e the m
ost significant 
market risks 
for t
he Group wh
ile other 
market 
risks are of
 lowe
r 


significance.  


 


2.1. Foreign exchange risk  


 


The 
management 
of 
the currency
 
exchange risk 
is 
regula
ted b
y 
the 
“Currency Exchange 
Risk
 Management 
Procedures” 
which 
specify 


the 
principles 
allowing the
 Group 
to 
reduce 
the 
incurred fo
reign currency 
fluctuation 
risk 
to mi
nimum. The 
Group 
is 
not 
engag
ed in 
any 


speculative transactions 
through 
which 
it 
could 
e
xpect 
to ear
n profit 
from 
the 
open 
currency 
positions after 
changes 
in 
currency 
rate. T
he
 


limits are imposed by the Risk Management Committee and subject to review on demand
. 


The Group 
and 
the 
Bank 
monitors 
the 
foreign 
currency 
risk 
by 
calculating 
open 
currency 
position. 
Open 
currency 
position 
(OCP)
 is equ
al 


to as
sets in the
 balance s
heet and off
-balance s
heet less 
balance sheet 
and off
-
balance sheet l
iabilities in 
a single c
ur
rency. There are 


two 
types 
of O
CP, 
i
.e. 
long 
and 
short. 
Long 
position 
means 
that 
Group
’s 
ass
ets 
e
xceed 
li
abilities 
in
 
giv
en 
cu
rrency, 
whereas 
short 
position
 


means 
that liabilities 
exceed ass
ets. The 
Group also 
calculates 
Overall net 
open p
osition (ONOP), w
hich is 
the 
higher of th
e total 
short 


or 
total 
long 
position
s. 
As 
at 
31
 
December 2023 
the 
Group’s O
NOP 
to 
capital 
ratio 
was
 
0.
54
% 
(
202
2
: 
0.07
%), 
the Bank’s 
ONOP to 
capita
l 


ratio was 
0.
03% (
202
2
: 
0.07%).

The

has also 
granted 
loans 
in foreign 
currency. 
Although 
they 
are usually 
financed 
in the

currency, 
depending o
n 
th

currency 
of 
the 
debtor’s 
c
ash 
flows, 
th
e 
strengthening 
of 
for
eign 
currency 
against 
the 
l
ocal 
currency 
may ad
versely 
affect 
the 
debtors’ 


ability to repay the loans, which increases the probability of future losse

2.2. Interest rate risk in the banking book 


 


An 
i
nterest 
rate
 
risk 
is 
a 
risk 
to 
inc
ur 
losses 
because 
of 
the 
mismatch 
of 
re
-
evaluation 
p
ossibility 
be
tween 
the 
Bank’s 
and 
the 
Group’s 


assets and liabilities.  


Cash 
flow 
interest 
rate 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
future 
cash 
flows 
of 
a 
financial 
instrument 
will 
fluctuate 
because 
of 
changes 
in 
market 


interest 
rates. 
Fair 
value 
interest rate
 risk
 is 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
value 
of 
a 
financial 
instrument will 
fluctuate 
because 
of 
changes in 
market 


interest rates. T
he Bank 
and the 
Group takes
 on 
exposure to the effects 
of f
luctuations in 
the 
prevailing levels o
f market 
interest rate
s on 


both its fair value and cash flow risks. 


The 
risk 
management 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
Pr
ocedures 
for 
Interes
t 
Rate 
Risk 
Management, 
which 
were 
updated 
in 
2023
. 
Bank 
uses 
a 


system 
of 
internal 
risk 
limits 
and 
indicators, 
which 
establish 
methods
 
of 
risk m
easurement 
and 
set 
up 
measures 
for 
risk 
man
agement.
 


These procedures are approved by the Board of the Bank and define that
:
 


•
 
 
the Bank observes the principle to avoid the speculation with future interest rates; 


•
 
 
the risk is evaluated using a system of internal key risk indicator; 


•
 
 
Risk Department provides the information on regular basis to Risk Management Committee about compliance with inter
nal 


risk limits. 


From the en
d of 
year 20
22 the 
Bank and 
the Gro
up has 
implemented 
more a
dvanced 
methodology (SAS 
ALM 
tools) for
 interest rat
e risk
 


in the banking book management: 


•
 
 
In 
th
e 
cashflow 
generation 
non-m
aturing 
deposits 
core 
part, 
term 
deposi
ts 
run 
off 
and 
prepayment 
for 
fixed 
rate 
loans 
were 


included; 


•
 
 
Cash flows are calculated according to each of interest rate scenario, also forward curve
s are used in cash flows calculation
. 


Data 
of 
31 
December 
2022 
pro
vided 
in 
further 
tables 
was 
res
tated 
to 
present 
comparable 
i
nformation 
after 
the 
new 
t
ools 
implementation.

3. LIQUIDI
TY RISK 


 


Liquidity risk m
eans the risk 
that the Bank is 
unable to meet 
its financial obligations in
 time or that 
it will not m
anage to
 receive 
financial
 


resources during a short time by borrowing or selling the assets. 


 


3.1. Liquidity risk management process 


 


The li
quidity risk 
management depends o
n the 
Bank’s ability to 
cover 
the cash 
shortage by b
orrowing from 
the market; 
and 
the 
liquidity 


of 
the market 
itself. The 
Bank seeks 
not 
to depend 
on 
the ability 
to bor
row 
in 
the market 
in case 
of 
liquidity problems 
and constructs 
its 


liquidity 
strategy 
based 
on 
hypothetical 
scena
rio 
it 
does 
not 
h
ave 
access 
to 
market 
funding. 
Due 
to 
that 
fact 
the 
Bank 
p
osses
ses 
a 


significant debt securities portfolio, which is highly liquid and can be used either as collateral for borrowing by repos, or sold.
 


Liquidity risk management is regulated by
 the Procedures for Liquidity Risk Manage
ment approved by the Bank’s Board.
 Liquidit
y risk is 


evaluated 
by 
analysing 
the 
dynamics 
of v
arious 
liquidit
y 
ratios. 
A 
list 
of 
these 
ratios 
as 
well 
as 
recommended 
limits to
 their 
ch
ange are 


defined 
in 
the 
above-
mentioned 
procedures. 
Decisions 
regarding 
liquidity 
management 
issues 
are 
made 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
Risk 
Management 


Committee 
wit
h 
reference 
to 
the 
i
nf
ormation 
submitted 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
Risk 
Department 
or 
by 
th
e 
Bank’s 
Board 
with 
reference 
to 
the 


information 
submitted 
by 
the 
R
isk Mana
gement 
Committee. 
Current 
liquidit
y (up 
to 7 
days) 
ri
sk ma
nagement 
is 
based 
on 
s
hort
-term 
c
ash 


flow analysis and projections. The Market and Treasury Department is responsible for this. 


The Group controls short-term and long
-term liquidity risk thr
ough established ratios and limits. 


Starting from 2015, the 
Bank is subject to regulatory Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). Th
e Bank c
omp
lied with this ratio with 
a substantial 


cushion 
(requirement 
fo
r 
the 
LCR 
is 
set 
at 
100%). 
As 
of 
31 
December 
2023

L
CR

r 
a
ll 
currencies) 
s
tood 
at
 


214
% (31 December 
202
2
: 
189%). 


Internal liquidity limit system was updated in 2019. 
It includes
 normative, prospective, quality and concentration ratios. 


3.2. Structure of assets and liabilities by maturity  


 


The structure of the Group’s assets and liabilities by maturity is presented in the table below. Maturity bands used in the 
t
able represent 


maturities 
of 
ass
ets 
and 
liabilities 
under 
most 
likely 
scenario, 
which 
is 
contractual 
m
aturities 
scen
ario 
adjusted 
for 
expect
ations. 
For 


liabilities 
 
and 
 
assets 
 
wit
h 
 
no 
 
p
ayment 
 
breaches, 
 
contractual 
 
terms 
 
are 
 
used 
 
as 
 
the
 
 
representation 
 
of 
 
mo
st

sce
nario 
 
unless 


information indicating otherwise is available.

and Group’s balance sheets at their fair value. The valuation 
methods for the assets and liabilities are summarized below.

The fai
r value of 
fixed interest be
aring deposits 
is estimated usi
ng valuation technique 
attributable to Level

Interest 
rates 
for

of 
Šiaulių 
bankas 
are 
used 
for 
calculation 
purposes 
as 


discount rates. 


e) Other financial assets and other financial liabilities 


The

4.2. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value  


a) Fair value hierarchy 


The table below a
nalyses financial 
instruments carried at fair value, b
y a hierarchy of valuation 
techniques based on whether the inputs 


to 
those 
valuation 
techniques 
are 
observable 
or 
unobservable.
 
O
bservable 
inputs 
reflect 
market 
data 
obtained 
from 
independent
 
sources;
 


unobservable inputs 
reflect the Group’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair val
ue hierarchy:
 


•
 
 
Level 1 
–
 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This 
level includes listed equity 


securities and debt instruments on exchanges (for example, NASDAQ Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, Frankfurt 


Stock Exchange) or public price quotations (for example, for 
Lithuanian government bonds, average price quotations from the 


most active banks that participate in the primary placement auctions of the Lithuanian Government securities are u
sed). 
 


•
 
 
Level 2 
–
 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
 asset or liability, either directly 


(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). The Group uses fair value calculated ba
sed on Level 2 inputs for 


accounting of currency derivatives and derivatives related to 
prices of equity instruments.
 


•
 
 
Level 3 
–
 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on obse
rvable market data (unobservable inputs). This level 


includes Group’s investments into unlisted equity securities, derivatives related to interest r
ate floor in variable rate loa
n 


contracts and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. Details on fair value measurement of these instruments 


are described in subsection “Details on the main models used in valuation of Le
vel III instruments” (Financial Risk 


Management disclosure, section 4.2.b), below.

FINANCIAL 
RISK MANAGEME
NT (CONTINUED) 


5. THE RISK
 INHERENT 
IN INSURA
NCE ACTIVI
TIES 


The Bank’s subsidiary 
GD UAB SB Draudimas (hereinafter - the Company) is engaged in life insurance business. 


Insurance risk 


An 
insurance 
risk 
is 
a 
loss 
risk, 
or 
a 
r
isk 
a
ssociated 
with 
adverse 
changes 
in 
the 
value 
of 
insurance 
obligations, 
which 
are 
caused 
by 


improper 
pricing 
a
nd 
provision
ing 
assumptions. 
Bas
ed 
on 
the 
insurance 
contract, 
th
e 
Com
pany 
assumes 
th
e 
protection 
of 
a 
perso
n's
 


financial interests for 
the insurance premium in the even
t o
f insured events, therefore, 
there is a risk of i
ncurring losses due to improper 


assessment 
o
f 
the 
assum
ed 
i
nsurance 
risk, 
calculated 
insurance 
premiums, 
which 
may 
n
ot 
be
 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
the 
ac
tual 
ins
u
rance 


benefits and expenses, in case of insurance risk assumed by the Company. 


The 
 
Company 
 
assumes 
 
th
e 
 
ris
ks 
 
of 
 
mortality, 
 
m
orbidity, 
 
s
urvival, 
 
mortality 
 
and 
 
injuries 
 
due 
 
to 
 
accidents, 
 
t
ermination, 
 
expe
nses,
 


catastrophes.  


The 
risks 
of 
mortality, 
morbidity, 
injuries 
are
 
due 
to 
optimistic 
assumptions 
about 
future 
mortality, 
morbidity, 
and 
frequency 
of 
injuries, 


used in th
e calculations of insurance p
remiums, which would lead 
to the fact 
that future insurance premi
ums will be insuffici
ent to c
over 


future 
benefits 
in 
case 
of 
death, 
illness, 
inju
ry. 
The 
increase
 
in 
the 
risk 
of 
mortality, 
morbidity 
can 
be 
influenced 
b
y 
epidemics 
(AIDS, 


SARS), 
pandemics, 
lifestyle 
changes 
 
- 
a
 
change 
in 
the 
habits 
of 
ea
ting, 
smoking, 
moving. 
The 
risk 
of 
s
urvival 
is 
due 
to 
longer 
li
f
e 


expectancy 
than p
lanned. This 
increase is 
due 
to 
the developm
ent of 
medical 
science, 
the im
provement of 
the 
health care 
system, 
the 


growing standard 
of 
living. 
The 
increase 
in 
the 
risk of 
injury 
ca
n be 
influenced 
by 
non
-compliance with 
occupational 
safety 
in 
workplaces, 


the use of outdated technologies, increasing accident rates. 


The 
Company 
manages 
the 
assumed 
insurance 
risk
s 
by a
ssessing 
the 
state 
of 
health 
of 
the 
insured 
person, 
life 
habits, 
history 
of 
th
e 


state of family health. The company has a multi-level risk assessment system, depending on the size of the risks assumed. This system
 


ensures that the insurance premium paid by the policyholder corresponds to the i
nsured person's health.
 


Concentration of risk is measured by the insurance amount of the accepted risks:

The Company manages these risks through its underwriting strategy and reinsurance arrangements. 


The 
underwriting 
strateg
y 
is 
intend
ed 
to
 
ensure 
that 
the 
risks 
underwritten 
are 
well 
diversified 
in 
terms 
of 
type 
of 
risk 
and
 
the 
level 
of 


insured benefits. 


The Company 
follows 
the 
principles 
of 
conservatism and 
prudence 
to 
settle 
the 
price 
for 
insurance r
isk 
therefore 
the 
increase in 
l
oss ra
te 


of any insurance risk would not impact the result of the Group significantly. 


Insurance risk sensitivity analysis 


Sensitivity analysis is
 carried 
out by changing t
he corresponding as
sumption with th
e indicated 
value, leaving t
he sizes o
f other v
ariables 


unchanged. The reinsurance effect on the performed sensitivi
ty analysis is immaterial.

6. OPERATIO
NAL RISK  


Operational risk is the risk of experiencing losses due to improper or unimplemented internal control processes, employee 
errors and/or
 


illegal 
actions, 
disruptions 
in 
information 
system 
o
perations, 
or 
the 
influence 
of 
e
xternal 
e
vents. 
Operational 
risk, 
unlike 
other 
types 
of 


risks (credit, 
market, liquidity), 
is not i
ntentionally assumed wi
th the 
expectation of 
gaining benefits
; it ar
ises natur
ally in th
e course of 
th
e 


Bank's activities. 


In 
the 
year 
2023, 
the 
Bank 
continued 
to 
enhance 
the 
operational 
and 
reputational 
risk 
management 
systems, 
as 
well 
as 
incident
 
recording
 


systems 
for the 
Bank 
and its 
Group 
companies. Starting 
f
rom 
December 1, 
2023, o
perational risk 
incidents are 
recorded in 
the 
Service 


Bank. 
Th
e 
decision
 
to 
m
igrate 
to 
th
e 
Service 
Bank 
was 
m
ade 
for 
th
e 
convenience 
of 
JIRA 
functionalities 
and 
a 
unified 
registra
tion 
location. 


From 
now 
on
, 
operational 
risk 
inc
idents 
in 
the 
Service 
Bank 
can 
be 
recorded 
by 
all 
employees 
of 
the 
Bank, 
UAB 
"SB 
Leasing," 
Lif
e 


Insurance "SB Draudimas," and "SB
 Asset Management" UAB. E-learning modules on Ope
rational Risk were prepared
 at the beginnin
g 


of 2023. 


On 
 
Octo
ber 
25-26, 
 
2023, 
 
a 
 
Comprehensive 
 
Testing 
 
was 
 
c
onducted 
 
in 
 
the 
 
Bank, 
 
showing 
 
that 
 
the 
 
Business 
Continuity 
 
Plans 
 
and 


processes in place are suitable, with no significant deficiencies identified in ensuring busin
ess continuity.
 


Throughout 
 
this 
 
year, 
 
s
ignificant 
 
attention 
 
will 
 
conti
nue 
 
to 
 
be 
 
given 
 
to 
 
Business 
 
Continuity 
 
Management, 
 
Risk 
 
Management, 
 
and 


monitoring of Cri
tical Outsourced Services, as well 
as strengthening the operational and 
reputational risk culture across 
the
 entire Bank 


Group.

which 
are 
a 


part of

Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP). During 
this process it i
s determined if 
the Bank’s capital
 is s
ufficient to 


cover the possible losses which may occur because of the financial status deter
ioration. Stress testing for all of the risks is
 
performed at
 


least once a year in a
ccordance with the prudenti
al requirements. Ad hoc 
stress tests for se
parate risks are performed
 in case there 
is a 


need to understand the possible impacts of underlying factor

Business

During 
year 
2023 
Group 
companies 
have 
acquired 
two 
s

business 
units 
(see 
Note

Both 
busin
ess 


units 
were 
acquired 
during 
single 
transaction. 
Group 
ma
nagement 
has 
applied 
j
udgement 
in 
defining 
if 
business 
units 
acquired 
meet
 


definition of business as de
scribed in IFRS 
3 also if from 
Group perspective separate b
usiness units acquisition 
should be
 accounted as 


one 
transaction. 
Significant 
inputs 
and

were 
applied 
to 
perform 
purchase 
price 
allocation 
and 
calculate 
fair

acquired 
during 
business 
combination. 
Changes in 
these 
judgements 
and

can 
significantly 
aff

because of this 
business combination
. 
De
crease 
of discount 
rate used 
in fair 
value assessment of 
assets and 
liabilities 
acquired through
 


business combination by 0.5% (other factors held constant) would decrease goodwill accounted from the business combination by EUR 


2,131 thousand.
