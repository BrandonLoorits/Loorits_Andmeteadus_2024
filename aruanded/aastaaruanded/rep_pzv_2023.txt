Business Risk
s
 
The 
Company's 
core 
business 
is 
milk 
processing. 
This 
b
usiness 
is 
risky 
due 
to 
potential 
changes 
in 
the 
ma
rkets 
for 
raw 
ma
terials 
and 
products, 
competition, 
as wel
l 
as 
possibl
e 
legal, 
p
olitical, 
technological 
and 
social 
developments 
that 
are 
directly 
or 
ind
irectly 
related 
to 
the 
Company's 
business, 
which 
may 
adversely 
affec
t 
the 
Company's 
cash 
flows 
and 
operating results. 
 
The 
 
Company's 
 
primary 
 
raw 
 
material 
 
is 
 
milk, 
 
the 
 
supply 
 
of 
 
which 
 
is 
relatively 
 
limited 
 
due 
 
to 
 
its 
 
short 
 
shelf 
 
li
fe. 
 
Raw 
 
material 
 
supply 
restrictions 
ma
y 
lead 
to 
a 
shortage 
of 
raw 
materials 
or 
an 
increase 
in 
raw 
 
material 
 
prices. 
 
These 
 
changes 
 
may 
 
adversely 
 
a
ffect 
 
the 
Company's 
cash 
flows 
and 
operating 
results. 
This 
risk 
is 
managed 
by 
diversifying 
 
the 
 
purchase 
 
of 
 
raw 
 
milk 
 
from 
 
different 
 
(d
ifferent 
 
sized) 
suppliers in 
Lithuania 
a
nd by 
additionally importing 
raw milk 
from ot
her 
countries (mainly from Latvia and Estonia). 
 
The 
Company's 
business 
(especially 
milk 
c
ollection 
and 
delivery) 
i
s 
a 
labour-intensive activity. Staff shortages and increases in their salaries 
may 
 
adversely 
 
affect 
 
the 
 
Company's 
 
op
erating 
 
results. 
 
The 
 
risk 
 
is 
managed 
by 
investing 
in 
modern 
equipment, 
whi
ch 
makes 
it 
p
ossible 
to 
 
reduce 
 
the 
 
number 
 
of 
 
employees.  Remuneration 
 
and  employee 
motivation 
systems 
are 
constantly 
reviewed 
i
n 
order 
to 
retain 
existing
 
employees and attract new ones. We ke
ep up with trends and produce
 
products 
that 
meet 
consumer 
needs. 
H
ealthy

of
