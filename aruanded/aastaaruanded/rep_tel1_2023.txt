On the one hand, I had the privilege of leading a reputable, well-managed company with a significant impact on society — a company that’s on the right track. On the other hand, I was determined to achieve breakthroughs in all areas of strategic development crucial to our Company. Thanks to the phenomenal talent of Telia’s employees, I believe we managed to capitalize on past successes while making rapid progress with our strategic objectives. Let’s recap what we achieved together. The definitive highlight of last year was the historic NATO Summit in Vilnius. Telia Lietuva was entrusted by the Alliance to ensure the safe communication infrastructure and cybersecurity of the event. It was arguably the most challenging project our Company has ever undertaken in terms of scale, safety standards, time frames, and confidentiality levels. We rose to the challenge, and our efforts were not only recognized by local government agencies but also acknowledged by the White House in an official thank-you letter from President Joe Biden's administration. Regarding our broader role in society, much of our focus last year was directed towards inclusivity. We aimed to set an example of an open company that seeks to understand the needs of people with various disabilities and adapt our products, services, digital platforms, and customer service standards accordingly. I want to express gratitude to our inclusivity ambassadors — individuals who face various barriers daily due to their physical conditions — for their energy, enthusiasm, and enormous help in this field. It only follows that our Christmas campaign was also dedicated to the theme of inclusivity, encouraging everyone to be each other’s Christmas. Last year, we reaffirmed our commitments to sustainable change. We continued working on our key focus areas the environmental agenda, digital inclusion, privacy, and security. Our Net Zero targets were confirmed officially by the Science Based Targets initiative, with the ultimate goal of further reducing our CO2 emissions through the entire value chain. The biggest positive impact on minimizing our own CO2 footprint was reached via the continuous electrification of our car fleet. Moreover, high employee engagement and the integration of sustainability targets as strategic KPIs have allowed us to ensure the acceleration of our sustainable business model. Of course, customers remain at the core of our DNA. A prime example is 5G. Telia Lietuva invested heavily in developing the widest 5G network in Lithuania, covering 93-95% of the country‘s territory according to the latest data of Communications Regulatory Authority. This enabled us to set new data download speed records and become a leader in mobile data consumption, resulting in double-digit growth in revenue from billed mobile communication services. Much of this success can be attributed to fixed wireless access technology, which provides our customers with the freedom to have a reliable and fast 5G internet connection virtually anywhere. However, it wasn't just 5G technology driving our revenue last year. Broadband solutions also performed well and were supported by higher equipment sales. Additionally, our TV business received a boost, with the Telia Play+ platform demonstrating significant potential with its worldclass and original local content, raising the bar for TV content quality in Lithuania. I'm pleased to see that it is appreciated by an ever-growing viewership. We not only managed to keep the Company’s operating expenses under control but also, aligned with our goal to provide the best customer experience and with our business objectives in mind, we advanced our digitalization projects – a core prerequisite for future-proofing our business. For example, starting in 2023, our customers will always have the possibility to renew their contracts online fully digitally, with the most relevant offers reflecting their usage and lifestyle needs. Thanks to the implementation of our paperless journey, we now have faster, friction-free, and more costeffective delivery of our products to the end customer. As the CEO of Telia Lietuva, I am committed to ensuring that this year, we maintain our momentum and stay focused on our customer experience, the quality of our products and services, and sustainability efforts. We are well aware that in today's world, staying ahead means embracing technological advancements and leveraging them to enhance our operations and customer experiences. By doubling down on our digital initiatives, we aim to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately deliver even greater value to our customers, while remaining a change agent in Lithuanian society through our inclusivity initiatives and ambitious sustainability agenda. With the talent density of Telia Lietuva, I am confident 2024 will be another year we can be proud of. In the meantime, let's delve into the details of Telia Lietuva's year 2023 in this report.

Additionally, in July 2023, Telia Lietuva provided communication and IT services during the NATO summit in Vilnius. During 2023, the number of post-paid mobile communication service subscriptions increased by 45 thousand, while the number of pre-paid service subscriptions decreased by 6 thousand. This larger customer base, coupled with 9395 percent coverage of Lithuania’s territory by the 5G network and the continuous growth in mobile data usage, contributed to a stable revenue increase from billed mobile services. Despite a relatively moderate increase of 2 thousand in the number of FTTH/B connections, revenue from Internet services grew, although it did not fully offset the decline in the number of DSL connections by 3 thousand. The number of TV service users increased by 4 thousand over the year, following the shake-up of the entire TV industry due to the shutdown of Russian channels in 2022. However, due to intense competition in the TV market, TV revenue in 2023 was slightly lower than in 2022. Revenue from retail voice telephony services decreased in line with the continuous decline in the number of fixed lines. However, higher volumes of voice transit in 2023 partially compensated for the loss of revenue from retail voice telephony services. 20 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 21 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 Market information According to the Reports of the Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA), the Lithuanian electronic communications market during 2023 generated revenue of EUR 846.9 million, marking a 5.4 per cent increase compared to the total market revenue of EUR 803.5 million for the year 2022. Telia Lietuva continues to maintain its position as the largest telecommunications service provider in Lithuania, with a market share (in terms of revenue) of 38.1 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2023 (37.9 per cent a year ago).

Research and development activities In 2023, the Company continued to develop and improve existing services, digitalisation of the customer’s experience as well as deployment of 5G network. 5G connectivity today is much more than just faster Internet. Its availability has become an indicator of how well-developed countries are and reaching 93-95 per cent 5G coverage has put Lithuania among Europe’s elite. For each of us, this opens new spaces to work, opportunities to dive into virtual reality from any corner of the country, or maybe even to see a robot delivering groceries rolling into our backyard. With such a well-developed 5G network, Lithuania is much more attractive to investors and developers of future technologies. In June 2023, we introduced Voice over Wi-Fi technology a novelty on the Lithuanian market. The service provides the possibility to make voice calls where the mobile network signal is weak or is not available. Since October 2023, the content platform Telia Play became accessible without a special STB which was historically necessary for the provision of IPTV service. Holders of smart TV sets that have Android operating systems could download Telia Play LT app and enjoy all functionalities and content of Telia Play. 31 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 32 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 Risk management The purpose of the Company’s Risk Management Strategy is the creation and protection of value by addressing uncertainty, identifying, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities that threaten the achievement of the Company's strategic goals, essential for safeguarding our customers, employees, shareholders, assets, and brands. The Company's risk management is developed in line with the ISO 31000 standard for risk management and the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework. Risks that could impact Telia's operations include, but are not limited to, the following: Financial risk management The Company’s activities expose it to the following financial The Company's activities expose it to the following financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, cash flow risk, and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. The Group's Financial Management Policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the company's financial performance. The Company's exposure to foreign exchange risk is not substantial, as Telia Lietuva operates in the eurozone, and the majority of services are provided to residents and businesses in Lithuania, with most services and goods purchased from local or eurozone suppliers. However, certain foreign exchange risk exposure arises from the Company's international activities with telecommunication operators and suppliers outside the eurozone, primarily related to settlements in US Dollars. The Company manages foreign exchange risk by minimizing the net exposure to open foreign currency positions; therefore, no foreign exchange hedging instruments are used. Since 2022, the Company's income and operating cash flows have become somewhat dependent on changes in market interest rates. The outstanding EUR 30 million loan provided by SEB Bank, Danske Bank, and Nordea Bank is scheduled for repayment in May 2024, with interest rates set semi-annually based on a 6-month EURIBOR interest rate. The Revolving credit facility, up to EUR 50 million, provided by Telia Company AB, is also priced based on 3 or 6-month EURIBOR interest rates. The Company does not use any interest rate hedging tools. The Company participates in a reverse factoring or Supplier Invoice Financing (SIF) program where suppliers' invoices are paid by third-party banks within 7 days for an agreed fee, covered by the supplier. The Company does not incur any credit fees and does not provide additional collateral or guarantees to the banks. Payment to the banks is made in full invoice amounts within a period of up to one year. The actual term depends on several variables agreed upon by all three parties, one of which is the EURIBOR interest rate, which began to rise in the spring of 2022, resulting in a shortened term and a negative impact on the Company's working capital and cash flow. To mitigate the impact of the rising interest rate, the Company renegotiated the conditions of the SIF program. The Company's financial assets' exposure to credit risk is related to cash deposits and trade receivables. Credit risk of cash deposits is managed by limiting exposure to financial institutions with credit ratings lower than A (according to Fitch or equivalent ratings by Standard & Poor's or Moody's). As of December 31, 2023, the majority (95 per cent) of the Company's cash and short-term investments were held in A+ rated banks. The Company has a Participation Agreement with Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) for customer receivables. Under the agreement, SEB acquires the rights to the cash flows for certain pools of Telia Lietuva's receivables from the sales of handsets to residential customers. The objective of the agreement is to improve the Company's working capital by achieving derecognition of the receivables, transferring the risk related to the receivables to SEB using the so-called "pass-through" rules in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. 32 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 Social and ethical risks Risks related to capabilities, skills, competence, and leadership Risks related to supply chain and third-party management Regulation risks Privacy risks Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks Risks related to execution and transformation Environmental risks Risks related to cybersecurity, network quality, and resilience Risks related to corruption and unethical business practices Commercial risks 33 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 Risk management To manage the credit risk of trade receivables, the Company conducts credit checks on all customers (both business and residential) before entering into any new contracts, except for low-value contracts, such as additional TV packages or other value-added services (VAS). Payment control for customers' invoices involves several steps, beginning with a notification before the due date, followed by additional reminders after the due date. Services are restricted after 20 days past due, and contracts are terminated with penalties issued after 50 days past due. For residential customers with bad debts after sending additional reminder letters, the debts are either sold or handed over to external bad debt collection agencies for debt recovery. Liquidity risk pertains to the availability of adequate funds for the Company's debt service, capital expenditure, working capital requirements, and dividend payouts. Prudent liquidity risk management involves maintaining a sufficient level of cash and cash equivalents. The Company's liquidity risk management goal is to ensure that the minimum liquidity position (calculated as cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn committed credit facilities) always exceeds 2 percent of the annual revenue. In 2023, the Company's average liquidity position amounted to 3.2 percent of the annual revenue. To mitigate liquidity risk, the Company signed an agreement in January 2023 with its largest shareholder, Telia Company AB, regarding a Revolving credit facility. This facility allows the Company to borrow any amount up to a total limit of EUR 50 million for 3 or 6 months, with funds available within 2 business days. The Company's financial risk management is conducted by employees of the Finance unit in accordance with Telia Company Group policies, in close cooperation with Telia Company Group Treasury. Further details about the Company's financial risk management can be found in Note 3 of the Company's Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. Plans and forecasts To meet the growing demand for cloud computing services, the Company has acquired a 2-hectare land plot near Vilnius, where it will construct a new data center. The Company plans to invest EUR 10 million in the construction of the largest data centre in the country. Concurrently, the Company is also continuing renovations and expansions of its existing data centers. 33 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 34 Telia Lietuva, AB | Management report 2023 People Number of Telia Lietuva employees at the end of period 2,336 2,161 2,095 2,051 1,935 2,127 2,001 1,939 1,925 1,829 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Number of employees Number of full-time employees Telia Company’s most valuable resource is our people.

By reinventing sustainably, Telia reinvents better connected societies and improves the lives of its customers. In 2023 we have conducted our first double materiality assessment, which confirmed the material impact areas: — climate and circular economy — digital inclusion — privacy and security Of course, the remaining areas of impact are inseparable from responsible business operations. All impact areas are embedded in our strategy. Sustainable activities are impossible without clear sustainability governance: — The ultimate responsibility for sustainability oversight lies with the CEO, who also decides on the overall sustainability direction and policy commitments. CEO receives updates on sustainability performance every quarter and more often if needed as part of the CEO’s monthly updates. — Board is also involved and takes part in shaping sustainability direction via regular discussions. — Management level meetings are a platform where sustainability related decisions are taken. — Sustainability projects manager reports directly to Head of Brand and Communication and has the overall responsibility for proposing strategic content, goals and required actions and following up work that has been integrated across the organization. — The governance model of local sustainability is part of Telia Company sustainability governance. 75 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 76 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Preparing for CSRD Over the course of the year, Telia worked to prepare for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the related European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) that will enter into force in 2024. In 2023, Telia conducted its first double materiality assessment (DMA) – see the results to the right. In the DMA, each topic was assessed in terms of its impacts, risks and opportunities using two main criteria: likelihood and impact level. The assessment was made from an inherent perspective, meaning that it was based on likelihood from an industry and geographical point of view, but without considering the company’s current mitigation activities and controls. The DMA assessed each topic in terms of how the company impacts the outside world (society and environment) and how the world around it impacts the company financially. Telia assessed impacts, risks and opportunities from a 1to 3-year time perspective (2024-2026), which covers the company’s upcoming strategy period. For climate, a longer time span was considered up to 2030. Telia decided to consider topics with a “high” or “very high” impact materiality or financial materiality as material, and these topics will therefore be in focus in the company’s CSRD reporting next year. Overall, the 2023 assessment confirmed Telia’s current focus and priorities.

Certain topics that are on the rise but are not seen as highly material by Telia, such as biodiversity and water, are addressed in the environmental part of this report. Description of the 2023 double materiality process: 1. The identification of possible material topics for Telia was based on standards (ESRS and SASB), ESG ratings (EcoVadis, MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics, and FTSE4Good), as well as Telia’s previous materiality and industry-specific overview (GSMA metrics for Mobile). By drawing from various sources, a long list of topics was created. 2. An internal guide was created to assess both financial materiality and impact materiality. This guide established the basics for the assessment, including definitions for different impact levels (low, medium, high, and very high) and likelihood. The financial materiality guide was based on Telia’s existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, which evaluates risks and the effect on Telia if they materialize, through the financial, strategic, reputational, customer experience and regulatory front. The ERM framework was adapted to also assess opportunities in a similar way to risks, for the purpose of the double materiality process. The impact materiality guide was based on the principles of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to assess the impacts that Telia generates on society or the environment. These were assessed by the severity of the impact, which covers scale, scope and irremediability.. 3. For each subtopic from the long list, Telia specified potential or actual impact, risk, and opportunity statements to facilitate the assessment of each. The assessment consisted of using the internal guide to determine a scoring for each impact, risk and opportunity statement, which was given by two factors: a) the impact (on Telia or on the environment/society) and b) its likelihood of happening. This was assessed by internal matter experts, using inputs from the list provided in the “Primary sources for determining materiality” (shown on this page) as well as continuous stakeholder engagement 4. Roundtable meetings with the experts were conducted to ensure consistency across all topics. 5. The materiality threshold was established for topics with a 'high' or 'very high' heat map result. This means that topics with a risk or opportunity yielding a 'high' or 'very high' result are deemed material from a financial perspective. Topics that had an impact with a “high” or “very high” result are considered material from an impact perspective. In line with the ESRS requirements on double materiality, a short list of material impact areas was created based on those topics that had high or very high results from either the financial or the impact perspective. 6. After the findings were determined through the creation of the shortlist, validation was carried out through engagement with Telia Company’s Board of Directors, local sustainability leads, and extended teams. Primary sources for determining materiality included: — Telia’s own 2020 materiality deep dive based on desktop research validated through internal and external stakeholder dialogues in 2021 and 2022 — Learnings from the GSMA industry association’s project on metrics for the mobile industry in partnership with Yale University, based on stakeholder engagement — 2022 expert analysis on ongoing climate-related trends among key stakeholders and the business impact those trends could have on Telia in the short, medium, and long term, and a deep dive into material transition risks and opportunities for Telia in 2025-2027 — Updated human rights risk mapping and salience analysis with BSR in 2022 — SB Insight’s 2023 consumer trend studies, which identify how consumers in Telia’s markets think a telco should prioritize — Topics covered by ESG ratings, including how topics are weighted — Engagement with collaborative partners to get a deeper understanding of theme-specific impacts and topic boundaries — Concerns raised by stakeholders in the media and Telia’s Speak-Up Line — Continuous monitoring of policy development and media — Enterprise Risk Management annual risk assessment — Supplier audits Stakeholders are generally selected for engagement either because they represent the opinions of a stakeholder group (as in the case of a union) or because Telia considers them knowledgeable due to their expertise (as in the case of a human rights organization) and/or experience (as in the case of children). Salient human rights issues Salient human rights issues – are defined as per the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework: “the issue at risk of the most severe negative impact through the company’s activities and business relationships.” Identification of the most salient issues focuses on risk to people based on likelihood and severity. The latter is defined by: — Scale (gravity of human rights impact) — Scope (number of people who have or could be impacted) — Remediability (can the impact be put right or not) Salience is reviewed as part of Telia Company’s broader process to determine materiality and further analysis is conducted by the company’s Human Rights Core Team, which includes internal experts on various human rights areas. These experts regularly consult with and receive input from external partners and networks that Telia participates in. Examples include: — Children’s rights organizations such as World Childhood Foundation (on topics related to children’s rights, including the spread of child sexual abuse materials) — The Global Network Initiative (on freedom of expression and privacy) — Union representatives (on labor rights, including risks of discrimination) — Internal and external diversity networks (on topics related to diversity and inclusion) — Audit results through Joint Audit Cooperation (on labor rights in supply chains, including forced and child labor) — Continuous interactions with other experts as needed, including authorities such as local data protection boards on privacy matters — The BSR global non-profit organization for sustainability expertise on a broad range of topics. Access to remedy Telia may learn about human rights risks or harm through its Speak-Up Line, but also through other channels such as customer care, audits conducted by its sourcing department, employee complaints processes, etc. Telia’s Speak-Up Line serves as its operational level grievance mechanism to both internal and external stakeholders.

In 2023, in addition to continuing the reporting of the same activities under climate change mitigation and adaptation environmental objectives, Telia is also, for the first time, reporting on the eligibility of activities under the remaining environmental objectives. The EU Taxonomy is still under development. As illustrated below, Telia reports a limited percentage of Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities since telecommunications networks are not included (see Financial key performance indicators on pages 88-90). The telecommunications industry has highlighted this deficiency to the European Commission, advocating for networks to be covered in future Taxonomy delegated acts with dedicated, fit-for-purpose alignment criteria. Please note that complete environmental data for Telia is provided in the Environmental chapter of this report, including the company’s total carbon and energy footprint, the energy sources used and circularity initiatives. Assessment of eligibility Telia has assessed all of its economic activities to determine which ones should be reported under the Taxonomy definitions. The following activities have been deemed eligible for Telia in 2023: Under the climate change mitigation environmental objective: 8.1 Data processing, hosting and related activities: Telia reports data centers – facilities used for centralized storage, management, or processing of data, along with all the necessary infrastructure and equipment. These data centres serve both external customers and Telia's internal needs. Telia has scoped its reporting to concentrate on data centres meeting a specified energy consumption threshold critical for core network operations in specific markets or across the company’s operations. Moving forward, Telia intends to apply the threshold of power demand for installed information technology of at least 500 kW, as introduced by the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive. The company does not anticipate significant changes to the list of data centres it reports on as a result of this. 8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions: Unlike other units of Telia Company, Telia Lietuva does not offer such solutions; therefore, this activity is not reflected in the report. Under the transition to a circular economy environmental objective: 4.1 Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions: Unlike other units of Telia Company, Telia Lietuva does not provide such solutions, therefore this activity is not reflected in the report. 5.1 Repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing: Under this activity, the company reports repair services for mobile phones and customer premises equipment provided to individual customers or businesses through its own service workshops or those of its service partners. 5.4 Sale of second-hand goods: Under this activity, Telia reports sales of preowned and refurbished mobile phones, tablets and mobile modems. Assessment of alignment For activities reported under the transition to a circular economy environmental objective (5.1, 5.4, and 5.5), only an eligibility check is required in 2023. No alignment assessment was performed for these activities. In the financial KPI tables, they are listed as eligible but not aligned. In line with legal requirements, Telia intends to perform the necessary assessments in the next reporting cycle. 8.1 Data processing, hosting, and related activities There are three technical screening criteria for substantial contribution that need to be fulfilled under 8.1: — Implementation of the EU Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency, verified by an independent third party and audited at least every three years — Where a specific Code of Conduct practice is not relevant, explanation is provided, including the use of alternative best practices — Global warming potential of the refrigerant used in the cooling system does not exceed 675 No data center reported under 8.1 is deemed aligned, as EU Code of Conduct has not been implemented and refrigerants used are above the threshold specified by the criteria. 5.5 Product-as-a-service and other circular use and result-oriented service models: Under this activity, the company reports the provision of mobile phones and office equipment to business customers through its Device-as-a-Service offering. TV and media-related activities (8.3 and 13.3 under the climate change adaptation environmental objective) have been deemed insignificant, as only CAPEX and OPEX related to implemented adaptation solutions can be reported. There is uncertainty regarding reporting under the climate change adaptation environmental objective, despite guidance from the European Commission. The company has also assessed several additional economic activities that constitute purchase of Taxonomy-aligned outputs under the climate change mitigation objective, namely: 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power 4.11 Storage of thermal energy 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles No turnover can be reported for these activities, and the related financial KPIs would constitute OPEX under Taxonomy definitions, which is not material for Telia’s business model. Therefore, these economic activities have been excluded from the reporting scope. Telia will continue to monitor future guidance and adjust its reporting in light of emerging best practices. 86 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Taxonomy reporting Do no significant harm For activities reported under the transition to a circular economy environmental objective (5.1, 5.4, and 5.5), only an eligibility check is required in 2023. No "do no significant harm" assessment was performed for these activities during the year. In the financial KPI tables, they are listed as eligible but not aligned. In line with legal requirements, Telia intends to perform the necessary assessment in the next reporting cycle. A “do no significant harm” assessment was carried out to assess compliance for the reported activity 8.1. Under “climate change adaptation”, the assessment consisted of Telia’s physical climate risk analysis at a company level, which is detailed under Telia’s transition plan and TCFD reporting. For the purposes of activity 8.1, during 2023 the company performed deepened site-specific analyses. An assessment was carried out to ensure the requirements are met under the "water" objective. Telia is not substantially dependent on water in its operations, and where data centers use waterbased cooling, it is re-circulated in a closed system. All Telia facilities, including data centers, are located in areas with connections to municipal water infrastructure. When planning its data centers, the company follows all relevant laws and regulations, including those concerning environmental impact assessments and requirements related to the assessment of impacts on water. Minimum social safeguards Minimum social safeguards are in place through the implementation of company-level policies and instructions related to, for example, human rights, anti-bribery and corruption, taxation, and fair competition. These policies and instructions adhere to relevant international standards and guidelines (see page 112). Furthermore, these areas are fully reflected in Telia’s risk management process, which is an integrated part of the business planning process and monitoring of business performance. More information about the risk management practices and Principal Risk areas can be found in the Enterprise Risk Management and Compliance Framework section . Telia’s approach to assessing non-compliance with any of its policies and instructions involves continuous due diligence and various follow-up procedures, including grievance mechanisms, audits, and controversy screenings of suppliers.

The undertaking carries out funding or has exposures to research, development, demonstration, and deployment of innovative electricity generation facilities that produce energy from nuclear processes with minimal waste from the fuel cycle. No 2. The undertaking carries out, funds or has exposures to construction and safe operation of new nuclear installations to produce electricity or process heat, including for the purposes of district heating or industrial processes such as hydrogen production, as well as their safety upgrades, using best available technologies. No 3. The undertaking carries out, funds or has exposures to safe operation of existing nuclear installations that produce electricity or process heat, including for the purposes of district heating or industrial processes such as hydrogen production from nuclear energy, as well as their safety upgrades. No Fossil gas related activities 4. The undertaking carries out, funds or has exposures to construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using fossil gaseous fuels. No 5. The undertaking carries out, funds or has exposures to construction, refurbishment, and operation of combined heat/cool and power generation facilities using fossil gaseous fuels. No 6. The undertaking carries out, funds or has exposures to construction, refurbishment and operation of heat generation facilities that produce heat/cool using fossil gaseous fuels. No Disclosure regarding nuclear and fossil gas related activities Additional assessment was carried out to ensure the requirements are met under “circular economy”: — Telia does not manufacture any servers or data storage equipment but purchases it from suppliers which operate within the EU. These suppliers mark their products with the CE label, as required under Directive 2009/125/EC. Compliance is also ensured through supplier requirements based on the Supplier Code of Conduct — Telia has specific requirements in place for its suppliers in regard to restricted and banned substances covered by the EU Directives on restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS) and waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) — Telia is compliant with local waste management regulations and requirements, as well as with EU WEEE legislation. In addition, the company purchases waste management services from suppliers with relevant licenses. All electronic waste is separated and reused or recycled (for more information, see the Environmental chapter). 86 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 87 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Accounting principles Taxonomy reporting The Taxonomy KPI definitions of turnover, operating expenditure (OPEX), and capital expenditure (CAPEX) are not fully aligned with similar measures used in Telia’s consolidated financial statements. For Taxonomy reporting purposes, some adjustments have therefore been made to Telia’s financial measures. Telia’s interpretations of the Taxonomy KPI definitions are based on guidance from Taxonomy publications, guidance from FAR (Institute for the Accountancy Profession in Sweden – FAQ on the EU Taxonomy), and consultations with external sustainability experts. The interpretations of the KPI definitions might change in the future as Taxonomy reporting guidance is clarified, and/or Taxonomy reporting practices are developed. Further efforts will be needed to improve Telia’s internal reporting systems and processes to fully align with Taxonomy reporting requirements. In 2023, Telia took additional steps to expand guidance for reporting units and increase data control checks. The three Taxonomy KPI denominators were defined as follows by Telia in 2023: — Turnover is defined as external revenue under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which corresponds to external net sales in Telia’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income, e.g., including only continuing operations. — CAPEX is defined as additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets during the financial year before depreciation, amortization and impairments. Additions to goodwill and film and program rights are not included in CAPEX. Additions are defined as investments during the financial year (net of any government grants received) and include additions resulting from business combinations as well as gross increases of asset retirement obligations (costs of dismantling and restoration). Telia’s CAPEX measure used in the consolidated financial statements excludes additions resulting from business combinations and asset retirement obligations but includes advances and pre-payments — OPEX is defined as direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plants, and equipment by the undertaking or a third party to whom activities are outsourced, necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets. The Taxonomy OPEX measure includes only continuing operations. Direct noncapitalised costs related to research and development correspond to the amount for research and development expenses in Telia’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income, excluding amortisation, depreciation, and impairment expenses in that function. Telia has adopted a strict interpretation of day-to-day servicing expenditures and has, for example, only included costs if required for maintenance of servicing property, plants, and equipment. Since Telia’s reporting structures and systems have not yet been fully adjusted to mirror the economic activity definitions of the Taxonomy, some assumptions have been made to establish the numerator for certain parts of the KPIs. For some of the data center activities, estimates have been made to calculate the share of OPEX and CAPEX related to external customers. These figures are covered in the reporting. As a general note, Telia has applied a conservative approach both in identifying eligible activities and when estimating CAPEX and OPEX associated with such activities . 88 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Turnover 2023 Substantial contribution criteria DNSH criteria (Does Not Significantly Harm) Economic activities (1) Code(s) (2) Turnover (3) Proportion of turnover year 2023 (4) Climate change mitigation (5) Climate change adaptation (6) Water (7) Pollution (8) Circular economy (9) Biodiversity s (10) Climate change mitigation (11) Climate change adaptation (12) Water (13) Pollution (14) Circular economy (15) Biodiversity (16) Minimum safeguards (17) Taxonomy aligned proportion of turnover, year 2022 (18) Category enabling activity (19) Category transitional activity (20) MEUR Percent Y; N; N/EL Y; N; N/EL Y; N; N/EL Y; N; N/EL Y; N; N/EL Y; N; N/EL Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Percent E T A.

With the annual average global temperature fast approaching the critical threshold of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, last year officially smashed the global temperature record. Similarly, according to the Lithuanian Hydrometeorological Service, the past year 2023 was the third hottest year in Lithuania since 1961. The warming planet remains one of the most severe risks we may face over the next decade, according to the global risks report. Telia is committed to addressing the climate crisis and the unsustainable use of natural resources. Therefore, in line with our goals and commitments, in 2023 Telia increased its focus on expanding our electric car fleet, as well as enhancing waste sorting competencies. This was achieved through internal processes, education initiatives, and ongoing collaboration with our contractors. We track our KPIs and their implementation on quarterly basis. Telia’s environmental targets Since 2019, we have pursued ambitious environmental targets, which can be broken down into three main groups: targets related to our own activities targets involving customers targets related to the supply chain Internal environmental regulations Telia's environmental impact is defined by the following key documents: — Environmental policy (updated and supplemented in line with Telia’s ambitious environmental goals by 2030) — Environmental instruction — Code of Responsible Business, which includes separate sections for "Environment" and "Environmental Policy” — Guidelines for the Group's vehicles (focusing on maintaining a sustainable car fleet) — ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard We have started conducting environmental assessments of projects, ensuring that our projects or innovations contribute to increasing positive impacts and reducing negative environmental effects. Significant environmental aspects where we seek positive change: Energy usage Electronic and electrical equipment waste Car fuel use Exhaust emissions from internal combustion engines 93 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Key results & future goals 2023 2025 2030 2040 93 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report — 47% CO2e reduction in own operations achieved since 20181 — Energy consumption per subscription equivalent was reduced by 1% (annual goal 5%) — We have exclusively used renewable electricity since 2019 — Suppliers responsible for 52% of emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods have set science-based targets (2022: 35%) — The entire infrastructure network that we dismantled has been reused or sold — 20 additional solar panels have been installed at mobile sites, with identified opportunities for further scaling on other buildings — Added the possibility to sign a contract online when ordering FIX equipment (by instalments) from Telia’s online shop — Over 100 charging stations have been constructed and 115 electric cars have been received — Heating and cooling systems in our Data Centers have been upgraded to more efficient systems — Increased of sales of refurbished devices (mobile phones and tablets) — Re-used CPE equipment part from all rental and sale equipment was more than 20% — 34% off all Telia Play new sales use OTT solutions — Reduced office paper usage by 10% — More than 16,000 reusable packages were used for transporting CPE equipment to B2C clients Science-based targets (base year: 2018): — Halve emissions in own operations2 — Supply-chain, upstream3: Engage with suppliers so that suppliers responsible for 72% of emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods have set sciencebased targets. — Customer use, downstream4: Reduce emissions related to the use of sold and leased products by 29% — Ensure that 84% of our own and network operations materials are reused or recycled — Science-based target: Reduce CO2e emissions in own operations (scope 1 and 2) by 90% (base year: 2018) — Ensure that 100% of our own and network operations materials are reused or recycled — Net Zero by 2040, aligned with the requirements of the new Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) NetZero Standard (Target validated by SBTi in August 2023) ___________________________ 1 Validated by the Science Based Targets initiative 2 Scopes 1 and 2 (market-based) 3 Scope 3 categories 1, 2 4 Scope 3 categories 11, 13. 94 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Identifying and handling risks 94 Evaluating global trends and risks that can impact both our business and sustainability goals is essential. To this end, we closely monitor the geopolitical situation and its potential impact on aspects such as energy resources, which could have strategic consequences. Additionally, we focus on the environmental situation, particularly concerning climate change. In response to the energy situation and our environmental goals, we prioritize signing long-term green electricity contracts with organizations producing 100% renewable energy. Managing power consumption through decommissioning legacy networks and modernizing sites is another strategy to minimize negative effects. Unfortunately, the waste market in Lithuania lacks the technology to recycle fiber optic cable, construction waste, certain plastics, and electronic parts. Therefore, this is an area that needs development at the national level. Meanwhile, we will continue to explore alternative ways to mitigate such risks. Moreover, we have identified environmental risks associated with heavy rain, snowstorms, higher temperatures, or longer heatwaves and have developed plans to prepare for and respond to such events if they occur. 94 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 95 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Climate focus 95 Since 2018, we have monitored and calculated our CO2 footprint. Telia Lietuva’s CO2 footprint: Direct company’s emissions (scope 11) tCO2e Indirect company’s market-based emissions (scope 21) tCO2e Indirect company’s location-based emissions tCO2e Indirect company’s emissions (scope 31) tCO2e 2020 0 0 12,200 70,000 2021 0 0 5,200 88,000 2022 0 0 13,000 94,0002 2023 0 0 10,667 71 000 2030 0 0 0 0 __________ 1 Scope 1: direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by Telia Lietuva; Scope 2: indirect emissions from, for example, production of energy which we buy (district heating); Scope 3: indirect emissions covering the entire value chain. 2 The increase is attributable to improved measurement coverage, which includes gathering data from more contractors and partners, as well as updated emission factors for Scope 3 emissions. Additionally, the implementation of our client's Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) equipment upgrade project has contributed to the increase. In 2020 we started to compensate the remaining emissions in our operation and business travel through purchase of voluntary carbon offsets. 96 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Telia's key supplier clusters, from a GHG emission perspective, are illustrated in the chart. In 2023, in addition to its push for science-based targets, Telia began to develop more detailed strategies for network equipment, mobile phones, and customer premise equipment such as routers and TV set-top boxes. These strategies include circularity initiatives related to both suppliers and Telia's own offerings and practices. Telia also identified its most material products and services to focus on in the coming years from a climate transition perspective. This work will continue in 2024 as Telia further develops its transition plan. In 2022, Telia and Accenture conducted emission modeling from a 2030 and 2040 perspective. This modeling considered factors such as Telia’s current goals, planned actions, and expected effects from external drivers such as policy developments, the pace of energy transition, electrification, and digitalization. The modeling results illustrated the need for an increased reduction pace in Telia’s supply chain, as well as the need for a circular shift within the company, the telecom industry, and society. Various related policy measures, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the EU Green Deal, as well as efficient carbon pricing mechanisms, are crucial for Telia and other companies to achieve their netzero goals. Telia therefore pursues targeted policy engagement, both in the local context and in global settings such as COP28. Where do the CO2 emissions come from1 ___________ 1 Shares based on Telia‘s 2023 emissions calculation The vast majority of Telia Lietuva’s value chain CO2 emissions are generated in our supply chain; meanwhile only 3% of all emissions are coming from own operations. 73% Supply chain Scope 3: categories 1+2 20% Customer use Scope 3: categories 11+13 3% Telia’s operations Scope 1+2 — Network construction and maintenance — Network equipment — Mobile phones and other hardware — Other purchased goods and service 96 4% Scope 3: other categories Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 97 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 From renewable energy to smart solutions — Additionally, we focus on electricity savings, and efficient use. We use 100% green electricity: — Increasing energy efficiency through new network hardware and power-saving features` — We use a smart mobile base station “hibernation” programme: during the periods of low load, Telia’s base stations are switched off, saving up to 10% of electricity. Managing energy while digitalizing society — Our fleet expanded with 115 electric cars in 2023. This has a huge impact on our emissions reduction. We plan to continue our own car fleet electrification in 2024 as well. Electrification of our car fleet – now every third car is electric — Heating and cooling systems in our Data Centers have been upgraded to 3x more efficient. . Innovative cooling technology used in Telia’s data centres: — this allows us to save up to 45% of electricity consumed by compressors. We have applied free-cooling solutions using outdoor air in Telia’s technical premises: We encourage our employees to use car-sharing services, with a significant portion of our cars being electric. Additionally, we promote the use of bicycles and scooters during the warm season as alternative transportation options. 98 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Circularity Year Amount (in tonnes) 2019 674 2020 630 2021 9881 2022 699 2023 712 2030 0 __________ 1 Since 2021, we have started to obtain detailed information from our contractors about the waste they generate in conducting works related to Telia. This data collection from our contractors has resulted in elevated waste levels in 2021 compared to 2020. Application of the circular economy model Waste hierarchy Most favoured option Least favoured option Prevent Reduce Reuse Recycle Incineration Landfill 98 We are continuously exploring the most effective ways to apply the circular economy model to achieve tangible results and create real value for both our customers and the market. At Telia, we prioritize moving up the waste hierarchy to prevent and reduce waste, while also increasing reuse and recycling efforts. However, it's important to note that incineration with energy recovery is a common practice in Lithuania. It is important for us to understand the amount of waste generated throughout Telia and its contractors. To achieve this, we monitor, collect, and analyze not only our own data but also the data of our partners. Continuous efforts are made to enhance data collection and quality. Currently, contractors and waste management suppliers provide Telia with estimates on a best-effort basis. However, they are adapting to provide the company with Telia-specific data in the coming years. Waste generated in Telia’s activities: 70% of waste from our own operations was reused or recycled Reuse 1% Recycle 69% Incineration with energy recovery 28% Sent to landfill 2% Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 99 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Refurbished & re-used equipment 99 In 2021, Telia together with Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefónica (with O2, Vivo and Movistar brands) and Vodafone launched a pan-industry Eco Rating labeling scheme. This scheme introduced a harmonized scoring system to assess the environmental impact of smartphones and feature phones. At its inception, the scheme had 16 participating suppliers. By the end of 2023, the number of participating suppliers had increased to more than 20, representing the majority of the European smartphone market by sales volume. It's important to note that all participating suppliers support Eco Rating on a voluntary basis and not as a mandatory requirement. One of main goals of the initiative, is to raise awareness and transparency by creating a consistent way for consumers to identify and compare the most sustainable mobile phones. Additionally, the scheme aims to encourage and incentivize suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of their devices. The Eco Rating of a specific handset is determined based on a common methodology that evaluates up to 19 different criteria, as provided by manufacturers. An objectively determined rating, with a maximum of 100 points, indicates the environmental friendliness of the device throughout its lifecycle. Eco Rating Telia was the first in Lithuania to introduce refurbished handsets. These are used devices, which Telia’s experts thoroughly inspect, upgrade and prepare for re-use. Refurbished handsets are a more sustainable and wallet-friendly alternative to new phones. Choosing such a device allows for saving approximately 55 kg of CO2 that would be emitted in the production of a handset. Refurbished & re-used equipment sold or leased : — Telia offers refurbished phones and tablets (as of 2022) with extended 24 months warranty both to residents and businesses. — CPE equipment — MBB routers — Work equipment used by employees is also reused By end of 2023 more than 500 devices were rated. Updated methodology and new label starting January 1st, 2023. In 2023 by reusing and recycling our own and our customers' mobile phones, laptops, household electronics, we were able to avoid at least 127t CO2 emissions into the environment. Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 100 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Other circularity examples 100 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report We collect and sort old customer equipment: — Customers can always bring their old devices to Telia Lietuva’s stores. In 2023, we refurbished more than 34,000 pieces of other equipment, including routers and set-top boxes — We offer mobile phone cases made from easily degradable materials in our product assortment, providing sustainable alternatives to plastic. — At Telia HQ, we have implemented a food waste collection program, with 61% of Telia employees participating. We are giving up paper: — More than 16,000 reusable packages were utilized for B2C client CPE equipment transportation, marking a growth of over 2 times compared to 2022) — We continue to reduce the amount of paper used in the office, cutting down the use of paper packages by 19% (compared to 2022). — Paper invoices were reduced by 9,273 as the customers who were receiving them simultaneously can get their bill information via other methods 101 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Water and biodiversity Own Operations Water is not considered a material environmental aspect for Telia’s own operations based on the company’s double materiality assessment and related materiality threshold. Some data center facilities have water-based cooling, but water is recirculated in closed systems. In addition to the closed-loop water cooling, there are a few cooling sites where water is sprayed on the outdoor chiller elements (and vaporized) during peak temperatures, thereby increasing the cooling capacity without increasing energy consumption. Since the solution is in operation for only a few hours each year, the impact on total water consumption is minor (<10%). Water consumed in offices and in other locations is used for sanitary purposes and kitchen/canteen activities only. All Telia facilities, including data centers, are located in built areas with connections to municipal water infrastructure. Telia impacts biodiversity but based on the double materiality assessment and related materiality threshold, this is not regarded as a material environment aspect for its own operations. Telia provides significant network infrastructures in the countries where it operates, but the inherent risk is reduced due to local environmental legislation when doing construction and maintenance of those sites and the fact that the infrastructure is mostly built in environments that are already built and occupied by human activities. Mitigation activities include avoiding building on non-built land and limiting the land area affected. In sensitive nature areas precautionary measures are taken, often also established by law. Biodiversity risks are also mitigated by Telia’s zero waste goal, meaning that, from 2030 onwards, the company aims to send no waste to incinerators or landfills. Value Chain Water and biodiversity aspects are important in parts of Telia’s supply chain – for example, in certain electronics manufacturing processes and in mineral extraction activities. Suppliers are required to identify and manage all significant environmental aspects associated with their operations, apply the precautionary principle and impose the same requirements on their subcontractors. These requirements also apply for water and biodiversity, when relevant. Moreover, Telia’s circularity agenda is another way of limiting negative impacts on ecosystems in the supply chain by, for example, applying circular business models to prolong the lifetime of hardware and thereby limiting the extraction of new minerals. Eco Rating, which promotes the durability, repairability and recyclability of the materials used in smartphones, is another example of initiatives that aim to limit negative impacts on the environment, including both water and biodiversity. Moreover, Telia’s broader climate change program indirectly limits negative biodiversity risks caused by climate change, as well as pollution from transport, as an example. Biodiversity is on Telia’s watch list of where the aim is to better understand these impacts in the coming years. In 2023, the industry association GSMA created a joint working group in which Telia is part of for this purpose. 101 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 102 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 102 Our employees: environmental ambassadors We are a large organization of more than 2,000 people. Our employees are the greatest ambassadors of our efforts; therefore, we are constantly engaging with them on topics such as the environment, sustainability, and responsible behaviour, providing them with useful information, and involving them in various activities and initiatives. How do we do this? — People who have just joined the Telia team are immediately introduced to our business strategy, activities and the achieved results. — All newcomers are introduced to our sustainability area during the newcomers‘ day. — All employees are acquainted with the company’s internal policies and instructions relating to sustainable operations, and the environment. — We hold e-trainings for employees on environmental protection and ecodesign. Environmental trainings are mandatory. — We have an information section on the environment and sustainability on the company's intranet, listing contact details of the responsible employees so that everyone knows whom to refer to in case of questions, suggestions or ideas. In 2023 a new mandatory nano-learnings on waste streams (comprising five modules) were introduced for all employees. Each of the five topics focus on different waste streams and provides key practical tips for proper waste sorting. By the end of 2023, 47% of employees had completed this mandatory course. Additional trainings and events: — In April employees of Telia's showrooms met with our partner in electronic waste handling UAB "Atliekų tvarkymo centras" to learn more about electronic waste and legal regulation of waste accounting. — In November, all Telia employees were invited to an educational event titled "Dispelling Waste Sorting Myths." During the visit of specialists from "Žaliasis taškas" to the Telia office, the key rules of proper waste sorting were reiterated. Telia employees also had the opportunity to enhance their sorting skills in practice and receive answers to their questions. Following the event, employees tested their knowledge in the quiz "Let's Sort Correctly," and the three best answers received symbolic prizes. Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 103 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Joint efforts for a greener tomorrow: suppliers We also involve suppliers in environmental protection We have estimated that as many as 90% of emissions in our value chain are originating from our supply chain. Therefore, we have closely cooperated with our suppliers in pursuit of our targets. When working with its partners and suppliers, Telia relies on the three key aspects: — Impact which we can make directly: we work with partners and companies in other sectors to reduce carbon emissions from both manufacturing and other activities. — Science-Based Targets (SBTI): we call on our suppliers to set science-based or equivalent environmental targets and to take all measures to reduce their absolute greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. — Inclusion and Support: We collaborate with our suppliers, sharing information and best practices to encourage the development of environmental plans aimed at achieving climate-neutral performance throughout the value chain by 2030, including our subcontractors. Highlights & focus areas 2023: Practices used to achieve a breakthrough: — All suppliers working with Telia sign the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct which sets out specific environmental requirements, such as the materials that suppliers must avoid or refuse altogether in the products supplied to us. — Suppliers’ Code of Conduct has more detailed environmental requirements including general environmental requirements; climate change mitigation; circularity and waste management; specific environmental requirements. — Some new suppliers complete an Environmental Questionnaire, which also contains questions related to CO2 emissions, assessing the current environmental impact of their suppliers' CO2, as well as a list of measures to be taken to reduce this impact. This questionnaire is used as one of the criteria for the selection of suppliers. — We ask our suppliers to follow Telia's requirements responsibly and periodically hold the related inspections to consult and advise organizations on what they can do to improve. — We have created a special Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Memorandum that we share with all of our contractors. — We ask contractors to provide information on waste amounts and their treatment methods in conducting the works ordered by Telia. — When holing public procurement procedures, we lay down clear environmental requirements to be met by service providers and the products they offer. We also started to consult with designers in search of circular solutions for the installation of new showrooms. In March 2023, our real estate team had a discussion with construction waste handler “UAB Ekobazė”. The situation of construction waste in Lithuania was discussed to find new ideas and possible solutions to improve our construction waste recycling or reuse rates. At the end of 2023, suppliers responsible Suppliers responsible for 52% of supply chain emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods have set science-based targets 104 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Digital inclusion 104 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 105 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Digital inclusion Priority groups of Telia's digital inclusion project: Children and young people Elderly residents Most vulnerable groups of the society, such as migrants Our goals Today, access to a reliable connection and possession of digital skills are essential to each of us, regardless of age, education, place of residence, activity or other circumstances. Telia’s Digital Inclusion strategy is built on two key pillars: 1) Providing reliable access to connectivity 2) Building digital skills. In line with this strategy, we launched a group-wide digital skills program in 2021, based on analyses of local needs. Our initial goal was to reach one million individuals through these digital skills initiatives by 2025. Remarkably, we achieved this milestone three years earlier than expected. As a result, our new goal, set in early 2023, is to add another million and reach 2 million people across all of Telia's markets by 2025 through various digital inclusion initiatives. In 2023, Telia Lietuva reached** over 32,000 individuals through various digital inclusion initiatives, bringing the cumulative total since 2022 to 53,000 individuals Digital Inclusion Benchmark. The World Benchmarking Alliance has undertaken the task of developing transformative benchmarks to assess companies' performance on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2023, 200 keystone digital companies were benchmarked across four measurement areas: access, skills, use, and innovation. Telia was ranked 12th out of 200 global companies, and 4th among companies in Europe in Digital Inclusion Benchmark. Today, connectivity is an undeniable part of everyday life. The Internet has revolutionized the way people interact, exercise their freedom of expression and information, and uphold fundamental rights. Digitalization is currently transforming societies, presenting both opportunities and risks. Therefore, we are committed to providing the best connectivity services to help society fully enjoy their cultural, civil, and political rights At the end of 2023, Telia Lietuva provided: 105 Our goals 2023 progress 2025 1.36 million people 53,000 people 2 million people 75,000 people * Data of Communications Regulatory Authority Telia Lietuva’s mobile internet is the fastest in Lithuania** with 202.1 Mbps (compared to 159.9 Mbps a year ago) In 2023, we installed 852 km of fibre-optic internet cable. Its total length in Lithuania has reached 36,862 km. EUR 7.8 million in mobile network investments in 2023 93-95% of the territory with 5G coverage* 95-97% of the territory with 4G coverage * ** Reach refers to the number of individuals that Telia has reached via its digital inclusion initiatives. Individuals covered are those who risk being disadvantaged, digitally excluded, or placed in a vulnerable situation. Both physical and digital channels are used. Formats and channels are shaped by target group needs and the potential they offer to reach specific groups of individuals. Reach by digital inclusion initiatives includes direct reach (number of participants in face-to-face training programs, seminars, workshops, or other digital skills-building events) and indirect reach (number of unique viewers of specific websites with digital skills-building guide materials, number of downloads of educational apps, number of receivers of printed digital skill guide materials, number of participants in webinars, etc.). Telia Company Telia Lietuva Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 106 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Accessibility Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report Telia aims to ensure accessibility for everyone by enabling those with disabilities to seamlessly utilize its services. Telia has updated its global design system to align with the European Accessibility Act (EAA-Directive 2019/882) and adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standard (at least WCAG 2.1 AA), which covers aspects such as color contrast, readability and screen reader compatibility. The company has initiated a process that fosters collaboration and disseminates accessibility expertise across the organization to ensure compliance with the EAA.. In 2023, Telia Lithuania collaborated with accessibility experts to conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit in both its physical and online stores, with a specific focus on visual disability. To mark White Cane Awareness Day and raise awareness about visual impairment, Telia personnel took turns walking around their retail stores with blindfolds on or leading a blindfolded colleague. As part of the initiative, a training session on physical and visual impairment was conducted by two guests, each representing one of the disabilities. The session drew over 100 attendees. Furthermore, more than 300 employees participated in a mandatory online course, equipping them with the skills to approach and assist people with disabilities. This course is compulsory for all frontline employees Accessibility in our shops and offices 107 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Centre of Digital Progress In 2023, Telia introduced a new information and expertise platform known as the 'Telia Centre of Digital Progress.' This platform aims to cultivate Lithuania’s Digital Immunity, enhancing the ability to identify digital threats and fostering innovative digital skills for future technology use. We aim to enhance Lithuania’s digital immunity to increase the resilience of individuals and businesses against digital threats and thereby enable society to use technologies. This is why high-level experts have convened at Telia's Center for Digital Progress. They aim to identify digital challenges in Lithuania, provide advice on how to transform them into opportunities, analyze which digital prospects are underutilized by society, and caution against threats and dangers arising from improper or careless use of technologies. Telia's Center for Digital Progress encompasses the following categories: digital inclusion, data protection and privacy, children's safety on the Internet, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. In 2023, we produced 30 articles, informing society and businesses about fraud methods, Internet risks, cybersecurity regulations, the capabilities of artificial intelligence, and the latest technological trends. Forming digital immunity 107 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 108 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 In 2023, Telia Company successfully finalized a project in collaboration with experts from Malmö University and Jönköping University, developing a methodology to measure the impact of Telia’s digital inclusion initiatives. As part of this initiative, an impact assessment for 'Augu internete' was conducted in late 2023. The findings revealed that direct interactions with school children on this topic are not only relevant but also growing in importance. This is particularly significant as similar information is not included in school curricula, and parents may not yet have sufficient information themselves. Given that children are gaining access to smart devices and the internet at increasingly younger ages, the program has demonstrated positive impacts for both participating children and their parents, as well as teachers. Cyber Security Game Spoofy Children's digital literacy is a crucial aspect of our sustainability journey, and our goal is to educate and foster creative, responsible, and safe young internet users. In 2022, in collaboration with our partners CGI, we introduced a free cybersecurity game in Lithuanian for children called 'Spoofy.' While designed for 5-10 year-olds, the game also proves to be highly beneficial for their parents, guardians, or teachers. While playing the game children learn: — the importance of privacy and passwords; — responsible behaviour in social networks; — how to recognise and deal with dangers on the Internet. In 2023, the 'Spoofy' game was released with a Ukrainian language voiceover, extending its accessibility to the Ukrainian refugee population in Lithuania and other countries, including Estonia. Initiative ‘Augu internete’ (‘Growing Online’) The ‘Augu internete’ initiative is an important initiative created by ‘Telia’ and is led by its employees. These employees dedicate time to meeting children and youth in schools, both live and online. During last decade, this initiative has been in place, the topic of safer internet has not lost its relevance. This is especially true as children nowadays get access to the internet at an increasingly younger age. Safe internet lessons organised in 22 Lithuanian schools More than 1,100 children attended the lessons Digital education of the society Results that were achieved by ‘Augu internete’ in 2023: 108 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 109 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Other activities Children’s Corner For many years, we have dedicated ourselves to developing a secure environment on Telia TV specifically designed for children. Parents have full control over the settings of Children's Corner, ensuring a tailored and carefully selected content experience for their children. The platform includes a built-in content filtering option and configurable time limits, providing parents with peace of mind. Silver Line In collaboration with the 'Sidabrinė linija' (Silver Line) project, we actively contribute to reducing social and digital exclusion among older people. 'Sidabrinė linija' is a free helpline that focuses on fostering friendship, communication, and emotional support for the elderly, and it is available throughout Lithuania. Our partnership with this project dates back to 2019. Telia's role involves promoting and spreading awareness about the activities of 'Sidabrinė linija,' with a particular emphasis on encouraging lonely seniors in remote areas to make use of this valuable service. Since the beginning of our cooperation, Telia's engineers have been distributing 'Silver Line' leaflets, inviting seniors to take advantage of the opportunities provided Smartwatch Parents decide for themselves when and how to introduce their children to technology. However, when children start going to a kindergarten or school, it is important for parents to know where their children are and to have a possibility to contact them. This is where a smartwatch for children, equipped with a GPS signal, comes in handy. More than 2,000 parents purchased smartwatch for their children in 2023. Webinars for business customers Small and medium enterprises make up the majority of businesses both in Lithuania and Europe. SMEs offer innovative solutions to challenges like climate change, resource efficiency and social cohesion and help spread this innovation throughout Europe’s regions. However, many of these companies or family-owned businesses lack digital skills and knowledge of how to make the most of digital tools. Telia in 2023 continued its series of webinars aimed to help businesses, including SMEs, to get acquainted with digital tools, challenges such as cyber security threats, and to be better equipped in their own digitalisation journey. Education material for parents and care takers Children's first interactions with the online world and smart devices typically begin early in their childhood. The individuals best positioned to teach them about safe online behaviour are their immediate family members or caretakers. Recognizing the need to help them navigate the increasingly complex and evolving online world, we have prepared short, instructional materials covering topics such as: — Screen time — Parental control set ups — Social networks — Family agreement and other These materials are easily accessible on our website and via QR codes in Telia Lithuania’s retail stores. We are dedicated to offering concrete advice on how to empower and protect children online. 11 webinars specifically focused on SME and 9 IT webinars for B2B customers. Over the year Telia Lietuva has offered 110 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Responsible business 110 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 111 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Responsible business in Telia For us, responsible business means effective risk management, minimizing the adverse effects of our activities, as well as ethical and responsible behavior towards our employees, the market and society at large. These commitments apply throughout Telia's value chain. We have clear priorities for sustainable activities, including in the areas of privacy and security, human rights, transparency and anti-corruption, freedom of expression, employee safety, diversity and inclusion, as well as responsible sourcing. We have been focusing on these particular areas, pursuing measurable change. Principles of responsible business Each of Telia’s employee follows the “Code of Conduct”. It serves as a “compass of ethics” guiding understanding on clear business standards and expectations, while also indicating that transparency in business is our shared responsibility. This document covers many areas of work practice: gifts and business hospitality, relations with public officials, protection of personal data, responsible procurement procedures, and many other relevant areas. In addition to our internal commitments, we are also members of the Sustainable Business Association of Lithuania (LAVA). This membership further obliges us to respect and adhere to the principles of responsible and ethical business. Other documents that define and give meaning to the responsible activities of our company include: — Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy updated in 2023; — Freedom of Expression and Surveillance Policy updated in 2023; — Privacy Notice; — Occupational Safety and Health Rules; — Supplier Code of Conduct; — Environment Policy updated in 2023. Human rights Telia adheres to the majority of international guidelines on human rights, labour rights, anticorruption, and environmental responsibility, including: — Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the UN — International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Fundamental Conventions — OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises — UN Global Compact — UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights — UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Moreover, as part of Telia Company Group, we have followed the universal Telia Company Group Policy on Human Rights. This policy encompasses our commitments to respect and support human rights, defining the key principles that we have pledged to implement in our operations. Human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent. Therefore, human rights risks are difficult to rank and compare. Still, it is important for Telia to identify the specific human rights that are most salient in its markets and value chain. In 2023, Telia incorporated this work, including updates, into its double materiality assessment, presented on page 80. Read more about our policies and their implementation on our Public Policy page. Children’s rights Children and young people are active users of Telia’s services. The company believes that internet access enriches children’s lives and provides them with opportunities to socialize, play, and learn. However, children are particularly vulnerable to online risks such as cyberbullying, online abuse, and inappropriate content. In 2022, Telia carried out a holistic children’s rights impact assessment of its business, based on UNICEF’s (Mo-CRIA) self-assessment framework (available on Telia’s website). Overall, the assessment revealed that children’s rights had been integrated into Telia’s business and operations to a high degree. During 2023, the company continued to close the gaps that had been identified. Examples include incorporating children’s rights more clearly in Telia’s Code of Conduct, which was re-launched during the year. Children’s rights aspects were also added to the compulsory Code of Conduct training and Telia’s whistleblowing Speak-Up Line. Telia utilizes a tool developed in partnership with BSR, based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to assess actual and potential impacts on children’s rights during its product development process. During 2023, there were no relevant service launches, and the tool was not used. The tool was used previously to assess smart watches for children, addressing concerns such as privacy and safety. The tool remains available for any relevant launches. We have a separate training program available for our employees, which focuses on children's rights in our daily work. 112 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Requirements for suppliers We choose suppliers and partners whose approach to sustainable and responsible business are in line with our approach and values. To this end, we follow Telia’s Supplier Code of Conduct. This document clearly defines the provisions and operating principles to be followed by our partners and suppliers. The Supplier Code of Conduct covers a wide range of areas, including human rights in the broad sense, employees' rights, anti-corruption provisions, fair competition, environmental aspects and others. A dedicated due diligence process is in place to evaluate our suppliers’ sustainability performance. The Responsible Sourcing function is responsible for conducting supplier sustainability risk assessments, including due diligence and audits. As part of its supplier management process, Telia maintains a continuous dialogue with suppliers to increase their awareness and understanding of its expectations. Any non-conformities are handled through corrective action plans and follow-up activities to evaluate their effectiveness. Other Telia procedures and policies, such as the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, lay down the selection of suppliers and the obligatory nature of the Supplier Code of Conduct for all Telia’s suppliers. Responsible sourcing 112 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 113 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Transparency and anti-corruption In the transparency survey, conducted every two years among the 40 largest companies in the country (last conducted by the Lithuanian branch of Transparency International* in 2021), Telia received the maximum score of 100 out of 100 possible points. This score indicates that we openly communicate with our customers, partners, and suppliers, sharing the principles that guide our activities. We advocate for transparent and honest practices and do not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. It is important for us that the principles of free and fair trade are observed, and that competition follows open conditions that promote ethical business. We always comply with Lithuanian laws and regulations. In addition, we follow our internal documents, including our Anti-Corruption Policy and Anti-Corruption Rules. We consistently engage in discussions about these topics with our employees and conduct various training sessions to ensure their understanding and compliance. We also expect transparency from our partners and suppliers. Open and honest cooperation can create a socially responsible chain of operations. To this end, we utilize an advanced platform for due diligence, which not only helps us assess but also enables us to maintain transparent relations with our business partners. In support of transparency, an open and feedback-based internal organizational culture is crucial. By fostering such a culture, we create a work environment where employees can openly ask questions, share ideas, engage in discussions, and collaborate with their supervisors and other teams. Moreover, for many years, Telia has maintained a social dialogue and partnership with the representatives of employees, including trade unions. On top of this, Telia has the Speak-up Line in place, which allows its employees, customers, business partners and suppliers to report (anonymously or in person) any problems, transgressions or other issues which may arise. 2023, two reports were received, which were investigated by the responsible Ethics and Compliance officer and Human Resources specialists. All the reports were smoothly dealt with. In 2019, Telia introduced a maturity assessment methodology to enable a holistic and credible evaluation and follow-up of key risks. Since then, the methodology has been used to assess the maturity of the Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) Program throughout Telia Company and in all markets. Results for 2023 indicate good maturity, with improvements noticed in internal control and third-party management. Throughout the year, ABC risk assessments were performed in all markets. With an overall score of 3.9/5, the maturity level of Telia Lithuania’s ABC Program exceeded the target set for 2023. This result reflects the continuous maintenance and development of Telia Lithuania’s anti-corruption efforts. In addition, we cooperate with the Special Investigation Service (STT). In 2023, we were invited to participate in the Academy of Transparency by STT as a speaker in the event "Gifts during the Christmas season," where we shared Telia's experience and the rules we apply to receiving and accepting gifts. Additionally, we are members and one of the founding members of the transparent business initiative “Baltoji banga” (English: the Clear Wave). In 2023, the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SCRPA) examined seven consumer complaints, suggesting that Telia's advertisements may be misleading, and issued four recommendations to Telia. In January 2023, competitors Bitė and Tele2 filed complaints with SCRPA, asserting that Telia’s marketing campaign, '5x larger 5G network,' is misleading. The operators claimed that there were no objective measurements issued by the regulator, and Telia cannot compare the coverage of 5G networks between operators based on information provided publicly to consumers by each operator. At that time, Telia's 5G network covered 75 percent of the territory of Lithuania. In April 2023, SCRPA gave Telia a recommendation to reconsider its marketing statements. Shortly after, in June 2023, the regulator published 5G network coverage calculations. These calculations revealed that, based on data collected until May 3rd, 2023, Telia's 5G network coverage reached up to 85 percent, Bitė's up to 5 percent, and Tele2's up to 10 percent of the territory of Lithuania. 114 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Privacy The protection of personal data is the foundation of modern responsible business. It is closely tied to trust, responsibility, quality operations, and the overall reputation of the company. In our activities, we adhere to the top privacy principles, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as transparent management of data when introducing new products and services. The company consistently monitors consumer perceptions of its privacy efforts compared to its competitors through an external survey conducted by Telia. By the end of the year, three out of six markets were ranked either first or second. In Lithuania „Telia“ was ranked as No. 1. 260+ customer care specialists trained in personal data breach handling process How do we do this? We integrate data protection aspects into every stage of our operations, including the development of products, processes, and IT systems, as well as the maintenance of services throughout their life cycle. We evaluate and analyse data protection considerations from the very beginning of projects, or even during their planning phase. We conduct privacy assessments and, if necessary, a Data Protection Impact Assessment, before initiating data processing, especially when such processing may pose a significant risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Privacy and security During the year 2023, data subjects filed 13 complaints with the State Data Protection Inspectorate (VDAI) questioning Telia’s personal data processing practices. Out of the 13 complaints, 5 were filed by one person. So far, the authority found one complaint partially founded and gave a recommendation to include more information in the privacy notice to increase transparency, which Telia promptly implemented. Telia made 3 personal data breach notifications to the State Data Protection Inspectorate as required by Article 33 of GDPR. In all cases, the authority concluded that Telia took all appropriate actions. In 2023, the website telia.lt was inspected by the State Data Protection Inspectorate as part of a planned cookie compliance monitoring action. Some gaps were identified and swiftly fixed by Telia. To further enhance cookie compliance, Telia adopted more advanced cookie management tools and updated cookie banners on all its primary websites – telia.lt, ezys.lt, and play.telia.lt. The new cookie banner follows best practice by giving website visitors the option to initially choose to accept only necessary cookies as easily as all cookies. This cookie banner was also used as a prime example in a training session held by the State Data Protection Inspectorate for data protection officers in November 2023 3. For the third consecutive year, Telia participated in the national cybersecurity exercise training – Cyber shield 2023 (Lithuanian: „Kibernetinis skydas 2023“) organized by the National Cyber Security Centre. 20+ IT specialists trained in privacy data mapping and governance Privacy achievements in 2023: 1. Reviewed and updated company policies and instructions: — Privacy and Data Protection Policy — Instruction on Employee Personal Data Processing — Instruction on Records of Processing 2. Held targeted trainings : 115 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Security achievements in 2023: — Thanks to its strong security capabilities and credentials, Telia Lithuania was chosen as the sole provider of IT and connectivity services for the NATO summit that took place in Vilnius during the year. — Our business segment conducted an analysis of the existing service packages. During the process 17 essential services were identified, that are security-related and address the main cyber security needs faced by our customers. — Preparation for NIS2 directive compliance was initiated. Work will continue during 2024. — Telia Lithuania participated in cybersecurity training organized by National Cybersecurity Center and phishing simulation exercise Phishex 2023. Security In the evolving threat landscape security is playing an increasingly important role. As a leading IT and technology company, Telia puts significant effort into securing service continuity and protecting its systems from cyber-attacks. Moreover, we possess extensive expertise in the field, and we share this knowledge with our customers and the wider society through various platforms such as the Center of Digital Progress, conferences, and expertlevel meetings. Telia’s ISO 27001 certification plays an important role in the continuous strengthening of the company’s practices and in its ability to meet its customers’ demands. Work to ensure business continuity Telia ensures that continuity and recovery plans are in place to build resilience and counteract unexpected disruptions. Telia’s Business Continuity Management (BCM) framework is applied to critical services, functions, processes and resources. It identifies important dependencies and risks and ensures an effective response to disruptive events. It also drives implementation of continuity measures and solutions. To maintain employee awareness about security matters, a continuous nano learning course is mandatory for all employees. By year-end, 63% of employees had completed the trainings. Privacy and security 116 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Freedom of expression and government surveillance We respect the freedom of expression of every person, as well as their consumer privacy rights, considering and complying with legislative requirements. We follow the Policy of Freedom of Expression in our activities, the main objectives of which are: — to reduce the risk to human rights; — To ensure that customers are confident that, upon receiving applications or requests from state institutions for the supervision and monitoring of communications, Telia will respect and defend their freedom of expression to the greatest extent possible. In order to protect certain human rights, we will always carefully consider whether defending some human rights may not violate other human rights and freedoms, utilizing all means and procedures to this end to ensure that relevant information is provided to controlling entities only in presence of the appropriate legal basis, such as a court order. In 2023, we received 91 request from state authorities to block websites or individual actions on the internet. We believe that the transparency of actions carried out by institutions aimed at monitoring or restricting people’s freedom of expression, is important in protecting consumer rights. The availability of such information ensures that groups whose rights may be at risk, including civil society groups, stay wellinformed. To this end, we publish Law Enforcement Disclosure Reports indicating the total number of requests we have received. 116 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 117 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Diversity, equity and inclusion Every day we create and foster an environment in which all Telia’s employees can feel comfortable and confident, remaining true to themselves. We believe that such an environment allows us to unleash our best qualities, skills and abilities, fulfilling ourselves and inspiring others. In Telia’s double materiality analysis, two human rights areas within its own workforce have been identified as important to develop: — Diversity, equity and inclusion – to secure the right to equal fairness and non-discrimination — Health and well-being – to secure the right to Health. One of the important documents we follow is Telia’s Equal Opportunities Policy. It promotes a culture of diversity and equal opportunities, encompassing the best working conditions for all, fair pay, and the prevention of discrimination and harassment. This policy is integrated into our Human Resource Policy and Remuneration Policy (both of which are publicly available) and is also set out in the Code of Conduct and other company documents. We have an established position of Diversity and Inclusion Coordinator within the company, whose main responsibilities include: — Raise awareness of diversity and inclusion through training; — Create an environment which is favorable to diversity and inclusion in all internal processes, for instance, employee selection, remuneration review. — Increase the involvement of different groups through partnerships, internal and external initiatives. To ensure the principles of fairness and non-discrimination, we conduct an annual evaluation of our employees' work results, considering their overall contribution to the company's activities. This assessment reflects both achieved results and the way they were accomplished, establishing clear links not only to remuneration increases but also to opportunities for professional development and promotion.. Compensation decisions are exclusively based on recommendations outlined in our Equal Opportunities policy and guidelines. Discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, age, religion, or membership in a specific ethnic group is strictly prohibited under any circumstances. We are committed to diversity and equal opportunities for all employees. To this end, we changed recruitment processes and internal procedures at the company, introducing special programmes and initiatives which help increase employee diversity and long-term engagement. Year Goal Progress 2023 2025 50/50 gender balance in Top Management Team* 64% women, 36% men (2022: 67% / 33%) 2024 All managers trained in unconscious bias and inclusive recruitment practices 87% of managers trained (2022: 65%) Annual Increase diversity in Telia and in the tech sector through continuous partnerships focusing on digital and tech reand up-skilling Regular interactions with members of diverse communities to showcase job opportunities and offer internships within tech *Top Management Team represents the Company’s CEO and direct reports. Telia’s priorities for equal opportunities include: equal opportunities for all; 100% gender balance in all positions; 50/50 no pay gap between genders, discrimination or harassment. 0% 117 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 118 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 118 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report In 2023, we conducted an employee survey to gain insight into awareness on the topic of disabilities.

This event involved inviting people with disabilities to explore 13 different job positions, ranging from a shop consultant to a data migration manager for mobile services. A total of 18 Telia employees volunteered as mentors, providing valuable guidance to the participants and offering insights into the diverse roles at Telia. Various job positions were available in cities including Vilnius, Kaunas, Panevėžys, Šiauliai, and Marijampole. We partnered with SOPA and created training sessions for people with disabilities from outside our organization. During this training, 12 external participants learned Excel, presentation-making skills, safe usage of the internet, and various other relevant computer skills. In June, we celebrated Tolerance and Diversity Month by bringing a rainbow piano to the office. Colleagues not only had the opportunity to play the piano themselves but also enjoyed a special performance by guest pianist Darius Mažintas. Furthermore, in July, we collectively participated in the Vilnius Pride 2023 march alongside Telia colleagues to advocate for equal rights. We continue our long-term friendship with the Women Go Tech initiative. This mentoring program, the first and only of its kind for women in Lithuania, encourages them to explore careers in technology. As is our tradition, Telia's mentors actively contribute to the project. Simultaneously, we actively participate in the development of the program and organize special events for Women Go Tech participants As part of the Telia Goes Red for Dyslexia initiative, we participated in the global campaign Go Red for Dyslexia. The campaign aims to shift the prevailing narrative about dyslexia and literacy, highlighting the potential of individuals with learning disabilities. In addition to using our platform to spread the message through our channels, we also invited our colleagues to dress in red to increase the awareness of our employees as well. 120 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 In our 2023 Christmas campaign, aligning with our promise that "Only your life is bigger," we specifically centered our focus on people with visual impairment. For years, Telia has been in search of a theme, an avenue through which it could not only stand out as a brand but also effectively address significant societal issues. Technology is particularly important to people with visual impairments; many express that a phone is as indispensable to them as hands are. Therefore, this theme and direction were selected for the 2023 Christmas campaign. Activities which we implemented: — We invited new volunteers to participate in the "Be My Eyes" initiative, resulting in a threefold increase in volunteer applications after the campaign. — Recorded 10 children's books for an audio sensory library — Ensured accessibility by recording audio descriptions for all Harry Potter movies, now available in the Telia Play movie library. (Audio description is a technology that supplements content with short and precise audio comments about the displayed image, allowing individuals to follow the movie without seeing it). — We recorded audio description for Christmas trees in 5 main Lithuanian cities (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Panevėžys and Šiauliai). — Supported the ELVIS bus, a mobile audio book library that travels around towns and remote villages of Lithuania, catering to older individuals who face difficulties in reading. A team of specialists presents audio books, provides instruction on using the player for listening to publications, and brings back the joy of reading. 120 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Focus on accessibility 121 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Attention to employees: well-being Health and safety The safety and well-being of our employees are our responsibility. To this end, we adhere to the international Health and Safety Standard ISO 45001, occupational health and safety procedures, and other internal mechanisms. In 2023 we recorded: — 1 occupational injury (accident at work) — 7 accidents arising out of or in connection with work — 4 non-list time incidents In 2023, 222 employees were vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis and 408 against influenza. In July, together with our partners, we organized employee wellness days. During these days, all employees and their family members had the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive discounts for various health check-up programs. In total, 189 employees across all Telia Lithuania locations seized this opportunity for additional preventive health check-ups... Work with suppliers We conducted four occupational health and safety audits at contractors' workplaces. The observations were communicated to the respective individuals responsible for the contractors, and feedback was received regarding the improvement actions implemented. As in every year, in 2023, we continued the disease prevention programme. We arranged periodic medical check-ups in Telia offices, and more than 1113 of our employees completed them. The company also financed the vaccination of its employees against influenza and tickborne encephalitis. Safety trainings Knowledge and skills on how to deal with dangerous situations can be critical and help to avoid disasters. For this reason, we periodically hold various theoretical and practical trainings related to the occupational safety of our employees. In 2023, we revamped our internal training programme, including: — Health and safety training for engineers — Training programme for workers who handle loads; — Training programme for employees working with heights; — Occupational health, safety and fire safety training. To enhance the safety and health skills of our workforce, we also organized training sessions for evacuation managers in showrooms. 122 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Attention to employees: personal and professional development Professional and personal development Continuous improvement and growth, self-realization, and the expansion of personal and professional horizons are among Telia's priority areas. As a constantly learning and forward-looking organization, Telia dedicates significant efforts to ensure that each of our employees has the best possible opportunities for personal and professional development, tailored to their individual needs. Consequently, we assist each employee in creating a personalized professional development plan aligned with their personal goals, expectations, and needs. And, of course, we provide the necessary assistance in its implementation. Mentoring programme On the path of personal and professional growth, it is always beneficial to have an experienced partner. That is why we are constantly adding new mentors with different experiences to the Telia mentor community. This is a long-term professional partnership in which the mentor shares their experience, and the mentee uses it to improve and develop their competencies. Training and self-development at work For those who prefer to learn at their own pace and in a convenient location, we offer access to the largest e-learning platform, LinkedIn Learning. It provides a wealth of content on business, technology, creativity, and other topics. We utilized Pluralsight and Cloud Guru e-learning platforms to develop IT skills. Additionally, in this realm, the Telia Cloud Academy played a significant role in advancing knowledge of cloud technologies. On top of this, high-potential employees get full or partial funding for studies at universities (8 employees in 2023) Other live trainings which took place in 2023: Training programme No of Participants Clifton Strengths team sessions 40 Personal resilience and effective priority management in a VUCA world 18 MS Excel basics 65 MS PowerPoint tips & tricks 45 Project management basics 20 Essentials of Agile 29 Creating an everyday learning culture Every year, we host a series of events called "Growth Week," which includes webinars, workshops, career fairs, and panel discussions.

This commitment goes beyond health insurance and includes reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions. Furthermore, it involves educating employees through various training sessions on well-being topics. Another step taken to further listen to the emotional well-being of employees is the Well-being Ambassadors programme, initiated in 2022. Through this program, we aim to train select colleagues to provide emotional first aid and foster the development of well-being initiatives within the organization. Well-being Ambassadors are equipped with basic psychological counselling knowledge, training in conducting conversations and providing assistance. In more complex situations, they are also trained on how to appropriately refer individuals to specialists. The activities of Well-being Ambassadors extend beyond one-on-one conversations with colleagues. Additionally, they contribute to developing wellness topics in team and departmental meetings (10 sessions in 2023). Moreover, they prepare wellness newsletters to share tips and relevant information related to emotional well-being. To ensure the well-being of employees, we collaborate with the Center for Overcoming Crisis (Lith. "Krizių įveikimo centras"). In the event of a crisis, the center provides individual one-to-one consultations, continuous consultations, or urgent assistance from a mobile crisis management team at the scene of the incident. In 2023, we had four emergency cases where we organized the center's emergency assistance. “Mindfulness and stress management” 285 attendees “Mental Health First Aid and other wellbeing method” ~70 people managers In 2023, 18 colleagues sought personal counselling after facing emotional difficulties. 125 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Attention to employees: knowledge sharing Students and internships Our experts shared their knowledge in lectures: — Big data conference Europe, Vilnius — Career day for Vilnius Antakalnis Gymnasium students — Career day for Vilnius Lyceum students — Turing college – AI & Analytics insider day @Telia — Turing College Hiring stand-up (online event) — KTU workshop In 2023, Telia’s talent hunting teams and IT managers attended 13 career events and projects of various scale seeking to attract new talent.

In 2023, 737* employees of the company participated in the programme “Kaupk su Telia” Combining work and family life It is important for us that Telia employees have a good work-life balance. To this end, we have offered our colleagues benefits in this area which are truly unique in the market. We organize full-day camps for the children of Telia employees during school holidays. In the summer of 2023, we organized camps in our big offices in Vilnius, Kaunas and Šiauliai. A total of 7 different camp programmes took place. A total of 192 children participated.

The insurance is valid not only during working hours, but at all times, both in Lithuania and abroad. Therefore, our colleagues can feel safe even while on holiday.

To attract new specialists, we invest in and develop various educational programs, offer a competitive value package, and maintain constant communication with our employees, market experts, students, the business community, etc. Remote work We had 1,216 Telia employees working remotely in 2023 Working for a total of 59,804 days remotely In 2021, we were the first in Lithuania to legalize workations. Now our employees can work in any European Union (EU) state for up to one month per year. This is highly beneficial as it allows employees to better combine work with family life and the need to rest. In 2023, a total of 73 employees took advantage of the opportunity to work abroad, spanning 21 EU countries. Attention to employees: workation Moreover, we allow our teams the flexibility to adjust their working hours. Employees can choose to start and end their workday earlier or later, meaning they can start working at any time from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and finish their workday correspondingly a few hours earlier or later. This option is particularly attractive to colleagues returning from parental leave, as they often wish to work part-time for at least some time. Remote work has already become a common practice that Telia started 7 years ago (in 2015). We have a clearly defined Remote Work Procedure, secure logins to the network when working outside the office, equipment necessary for remote work, and the habit of working remotely with high efficiency. We have also introduced the remote work contract which allows employees work only from home and receive monetary compensation to buy a table, chair and lamp. Of course, not all employees, especially those who have just joined Telia, have the necessary equipment for remote work at home. So, just like before, we arrange such equipment, including laptops, desktop screens, quality headphones, and other equipment, and deliver it directly to the homes of our colleagues. 129 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 130 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 Other activities for employees Telia fosters a culture of active life of employees. To this end, we invite employees to join different communities. We call this Culture HUB. The Culture HUB brings together different communities of colleagues (HUBs), uniting them based on their interests or aspirations to try something new. It operates like a separate, independent organization, hosting many small groups engaged in specific activities. The names of these organizations indicate their respective responsibilities: Sports HUB, Music HUB, Gamers HUB, and others. In 2023, the Culture HUB organized the following events: — Parents meeting parents and grandparents of Telia employees were invited to visit Telia headquarters and get to know their children's workplace (60 participants). — A musical battle of wits. — Culture HUB goes Kaunas battle of wits. — Cake day employees donated 1100 EUR to the organization "Pirmas blynas„. — Family day about 300 young guests visited the office, who had the opportunity not only to have fun, but also see where their family members, Telia employees, spend time during workdays. — Musical afternoon (Pride month). — Summer fest Culture HUB event. Attention to employees: other activities Recognition The People of Telia awards is an annual event designed to acknowledge those who have contributed to the success of the company and strive daily to discover new ways to improve —for their colleagues, customers, themselves, and the environment.

We invited them to apply with ideas how to re-use and resurrect old payphone booths (15 pcs). During the summer, the company received a total of more than 130 ideas. A special commission, consisting of travel journalist Orijus Gasanovas, cultural historian Sonata Šulcė, scientist, nurturer of architecture and cultural heritage, creator of Lego models Rokas Mikšiūnas as well as a representative from Telia selected top 15 to be implemented. 132 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 133 Telia Lietuva, AB | Sustainability Report 2023 A payphone booth in the centre of Vilnius features perhaps the tiniest dance floor in Lithuania, while in Antakalnis district Tech Park another payphone booth has become a comfortable workplace. Residents and visitors of Naujoji Vilnia are welcome to explore the mini-gallery in the payphone booth showcasing artists’ exhibitions. A payphone located near the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre invites everyone to “call” someone whom they missed the chance to speak to in time. The audio recordings of all the authentic stories became the basis for the opera’s libretto. The community centre KINAS Panemunė in Kaunas, on the outskirts of the Panemunė Pinewoods, has also implemented an original idea and set up a cosy cinema for two in the payphone booth. Meanwhile, at the Vilnius Adam Mickiewicz Public Library, the payphone booth has become a special space for telephone conversations. The payphone booth can even be found in the forests of Labanoras Regional Park, where it has been transformed into a bus stop. The Riešė Gymnasium repurposed the payphone booth for an outdoor library, and the Panevėžys Jūratė Nursery School used it to create a calming space for children with autism spectrum disorders. Another educational institution adapted a payphone booth for outdoor educational games.
