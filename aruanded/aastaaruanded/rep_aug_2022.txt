OVERVIEW 4 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.1. CEO’s Foreword Dear members of the AUGA community, In late 2022, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, commenting on the latest global forecasts on climate change and their possible consequences, noted: “even if countries met all their new climate pledges, combined with net zero commitments, it would get the globe to 1.8 degrees of warming by 2100”. Does that mean that countries’, business’, and organisations’ current emission reduction goals could be more ambitious? Yes. Today, however, the world needs more than clear goals and speeches committing to achieving them. It needs real actions here and now. Undoubtedly, world-shaking events, market instability, the energy crisis and supply disruptions have been causing tension on an international level. In 2022 these factors affected us too. The development of sustainable technology was delayed by a lack of components and disrupted supply chains. Energy costs rising to record highs created challenges in production, which consequently affected AUGA group’s financial results. Additionally, at the beginning of the year disrupted logistics slowed sales of the final consumer products. Despite all the difficulties, in 2022 we improved our financial results and recovered from the difficult year of 2021, when part of the harvest was lost due to natural heat. The Group’s gross profit rose to EUR 15.27 million in 2022 and was 286% higher than in 2021, while EBITDA grew by 115% from EUR 9.10 million in 2021 to EUR 19.58 million in 2022. The better results were accomplished with the help of better yields and, of course, higher production prices. In this sustainable business journey we have never doubted that we must implement our innovation agenda, because technology is the future. Without that, the agricultural sector will not be able to achieve its emission reduction goals and economic targets, farmers will not be able to work more sustainably, and consumers will not be able to choose food with no cost to nature. In 2022 we continued moving forward with our technological projects. We carried out testing of the AUGA M1 biomethane and electricity-powered prototype tractor in real fields. We made technical preparations for serial production and, after the reporting period in early 2023, publicly presented a tractor from the first production batch. We continued testing the specialised feed technology, which will significantly reduce the methane emissions resulting from cattle digestion processes. We worked actively to develop biomethane infrastructure and already in the first half of 2023, the first biogas plant will start producing sustainable fuel for tractors. Last year, due to higher crop yields and increased livestock numbers, AUGA group’s operating emissions slightly increased. Note, however, that the new technologies in development have not yet been employed in the group's activities. Their fundamental effect on emissions will become visible over the coming two years. We pay the most of our attention to the environmental issues, nevertheless, social and governance areas are also important in the group's activities. In 2022, shareholders’ ranks grew to include employees and participants of the first-year share option programme. We continued to responsibly take care for the safety and health of our employees in the working environment by providing additional health insurance. The independent Board also successfully continued its work. In 2023, its composition will be renewed, as envisaged in the company's articles of association, to ensure transparency and accountability to investors and other stakeholders. Our large team’s motivation, professionalism, and desire to create a more sustainable tomorrow have helped not only to advance towards the goals set in our strategy, but also to show that we can do more. In 2023, we are stepping forward with much greater determination and passion to achieve breakthroughs in order to live up to our mission “no cost to nature” and become a sustainable agricultural technology (AgTech) company. We believe that climate change can be stopped. By developing and applying technologies, we, first of all, aim to demonstrate leadership. Yet our ultimate goal is bigger – we will do everything we can to make a positive impact with the help of a strong community. Therefore, we intent to make the technologies we develop and test available to all farmers, who will be ready to work sustainably.

AUGA group is the largest vertically integrated organic food producer in Europe and a developer of sustainable agricultural technologies. The Group implements a sustainable farming model based on new technologies on organically certified arable land. For more information about organic farming and the sustainability practices used, see section 4.3.2. Organic Farming and Sustainability Practices. 1.3.1. Business Segments AUGA group operates in four main business segments in the agriculture and food production industries. Following structural changes at the end of the 2022, a new, fifth segment was specified technologies for sustainable agriculture, segment results will be published from 2023: ○ Crop growing – the Group grows organic wheat, legumes, rapeseed, sugar beets, oats and other crops. It additionally grows organic vegetables and prepares organic feed for livestock. ○ Dairy – this segment includes organic milk production and cattle raising. The dairy segment operates in synergy with organic crop growing, as it consumes forage crops used for crop rotation and its organic waste is used as fertiliser for crops. ○ Mushroom growing – the Company’s subsidiary Baltic Champs, UAB, is one of the largest and most modern producers of mushrooms in the Baltic region. It supplies white and brown champignons, oyster, portobello, eringi, and shiitake mushrooms, as well as compost for mushroom growing. ○ Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) – the Group offers a wide range of end-consumer products, including readyto-eat soups, preserved mushrooms, packaged fresh and preserved vegetables, milk, oat flakes, and other products. AUGA group sells products under the brand name AUGA, and also produces private labels. This segment is of strategic importance for the Group and remains the fastest growing. AUGA products are based on innovative food production standards and growing global consumer demand to eat healthier and more environmentally friendly food. ○ Technologies for sustainable agriculture (AgTech) – The Company develops innovative sustainable agricultural technologies (biomethane and electricity-powered tractor, specialised feed technology, etc.) through the subsidiary AUGA Tech, UAB, seeking to accelerate the achievement of the goals of the innovation agenda. AUGA Tech, UAB aims to concentrate activities related to the development of agricultural technologies, strengthen engineering competences in the sustainable farming field, and make the developed technologies available to farmers who seek to work sustainably, thereby contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities.

The Group consists of the companies below, grouped by business segments or relevant activities: The Group conducts its operations on more than 38,500 ha of arable land in the most fertile areas of Lithuania. The Group itself owns 12.6% of the land. AUGA group gains efficiency of returns by leasing of land rather than low returns as an owner. All the Group’s activities take place in Lithuania. The location of the Group’s headquarters and subsidiaries are shown on the map below: Administration, parent company AUGA group, AB Crop growing Agricultural entities Dairy Agricultural entities Mushroom growing and sales UAB „Baltic Champs“ R&D activities AUGA Tech, UAB FMCG production and sales KB Grybai LT Services ŽŪK “Agrobokštai“, “Agrotechnikos centras“ UAB Commodity trading UAB “Grain LT“ 8 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.3.3. Organisational Structure of the Group More information about the Group’s staff can be found in section 4.4. People and Social Responsibility. 1.3.4. The Group’s Competitive Advantages ○ Economies of scale – what sets the Group apart from its competitors is the scale of its activities. It operates on a large area of land. That, combined with still lower labour costs and the economies of scale, gives AUGA group a significant cost advantage. ○ Vertical integration – the Group grows a wide range of organic products and manages their processing. This makes it possible to offer a variety of final consumer products, such as ready-to-eat soups and other preserved products, vegetables, mushrooms, dairy products, eggs, etc. ○ Full traceability – the business model developed and followed by the Group allows full traceability from seed to pack and ensures products are of high quality. This helps earn the trust of private label producers, retailers, and the final consumers of branded AUGA products. ○ Synergies among different branches of agriculture – the closed-loop agriculture model, with its internal integration of the crop-growing, dairy and mushroom-growing segments, makes it possible to obtain sufficient quantities of products that meet organic farming requirements. ○ Creating and integrating technologies into practice – modern technologies are the key to future global progress. They will make it possible to curb the climate change. By developing innovative solutions for agriculture that are not available on the market today, the Group aims to raise sustainable farming standards and spark a breakthrough across the whole food system. Both consumers and investors will support such companies today and in the future. GRI 2-9 9 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.3.5. Export Markets The Company exports its products to 35 countries around the world. AUGA group’s most important export markets are: the USA, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Scandinavian countries. No products were exported to Russia or Belarus in 2022. Map of export markets in 2022: GRI 2-6 10 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.3.6. The Group’s Supply Chain AUGA group’s supply chain is extensive and complex. Implementing the principle of a circular economy, the Group can supply itself with some of the resources and raw materials it needs. For example, organic waste from animal husbandry (manure) and mushroom compost serves as crop fertilisers, and cultivated crops are used as ingredients for cattle feed. Also, crop products (straw) are used together with livestock manure in mushroom cultivation. The Group purchases fuel, seeds, and other products, and rents or buys the machinery from external suppliers. Raw materials produced by the Group are sold to traders or processors. Additionally, the Group produces FMCG products for consumers from the commodities that it grows, for sale under the AUGA brand or private labels. Those products are sold in retail chains via wholesalers or distributors. GRI 2-6 11 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.3.7.

Strategy In 2020, AUGA group announced its strategy to improve efficiency in all business segments and set a standard for sustainable farming. The Group is pursuing the latter goal, as the agricultural sector, in which it operates, is one of the largest environmental polluters in Lithuania and the world. According to the latest data provided by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2022 on year 2019, agriculture is responsible for over 20% of global emissions. Considering this problem and the growing need of consumers to eat more sustainably, AUGA group is paying great attention to it in its strategy. The announced strategy envisages the development of a new model for sustainable organic food production the Sustainable Organic Food Architecture (SOFA), which will be integrated into the Group‘s current circular economy model. SOFA will help to address the most pressing technological challenges in the food industry while maintaining a momentum of scale, quality and yield growth. The new business model attributes key roles to the following technologies and processes: 1 Creation of Biogas cycle infrastructure and biogas powered vehicles, which will enable to run farm operations without fossil fuels, using manure not only as a fertiliser, but also as a source of biofuel production. The emissions from fossil fuel use on farms will be reduced by 50%. 2 Specialised feed technology, which will provide an opportunity to reduce methane emissions from ruminants by 50% (calculated per one tonne of cow‘s milk), as well as improve milk yield. 3 Regenerative crop-rotation, which will replace cereal crops with perennial leguminous grasses capable of sequestering carbon and fixing nitrogen in the soil. Emissions will be reduced by 30%, calculated per tonne of dry matter of crop production. Feed Technology 13 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.4.1. The Goals of the Innovation Agenda The goals of AUGA group‘s innovation agenda are to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 (overall emission reduction target is 27%) and to become a climate-neutral food producer by 2030. AUGA group will be recognised as an asset-light business based on agricultural technology (AgTech). The Group plans to apply its developed technology not only to AUGA group farms. Innovative solutions and a sustainable agriculture experience will be made available to farmers around the world, who seek to work sustainably. What will the success of the strategy mean for each AUGA group community group in 2025: ○ To consumers – ability to deliver a consumer basket with no cost to nature. ○ To farmers – functionality of Sustainable Organic Food Architecture, which reduces carbon dioxide and its equivalent emissions. ○ To lenders – resilience in business structure through long-term financing and impact-driven lenders. ○ To shareholders – unique asset-light business model, assuring a 15% return on capital, multiplying Company’s value x3 and retaining growth dynamics after the implementation of the strategy. 1.4.2. Implementation of the Strategy The Company‘s strategy is publicly available on the AUGA group’s website and is consistently being implemented. Every year, the Company publishes both a strategy implementation report and its Annual Report on the Nasdaq website. The first result of implementing the 2020-2025 strategy was the AUGA M1 prototype of biomethane and electricity-powered tractor for professional use, which was presented in year 2021. It can save 100 t of CO2e emissions per year, compared to its fossil-fuelpowered analogues. During 2022, the prototype was prepared for serial production and at the beginning of 2023 the tractor from the first production batch was presented to the public. Other strategic projects significantly advanced as well in 2022. More information about the progress of agricultural technologies developed by AUGA group can be found in section 4.3.10. Research and Development. 14 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.5. Vision, Mission, Values With the release of the new strategy, AUGA group in 2020 has updated its vision, mission, and values, which are in line with the Group‘s day-to-day operations, goals and pursued results. Sustainability has become the core of the vision and mission. Vision – a synonym for sustainable food and lifestyle. Mission – food with no cost to nature. AUGA group’s activities are guided by the following values – sustainability, innovation, and positive impact. Sustainability Innovation Positive impact We care not only about reducing our footprint on the environment, and our corporate social responsibility, we are also developing new ambitious standards for sustainability. We aim to achieve business results while being a model for sustainability everywhere and at all times. Environmental protection, operational efficiency and new standards are challenges that can only be tackled with technology and innovation. In our team, we encourage resourcefulness, creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, continuous learning and new solution finding. We aim to achieve the best understanding of the present and future needs of our consumers and other stakeholders. As leaders in our field, we initiate change, create value, and positively impact the entire community. 15 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 1.6. Risk Management The Risk Management Guidelines were approved by the Company’s audit committee and the independent Board in 2021. Each year, the Group performs an assessment of its main risks and draws a risk assessment map, taking into account both the probability and the significance of risks. The main risks identified for the Group at the start of 2022 were: Climate conditions. Climate conditions are one of the most important risk factors for agricultural activity. Poor or unfavourable meteorological conditions have a significant impact on productivity and may adversely affect the yield of agricultural products, harm the preparation of feed, destroy crops and cause other damage. Any damage caused by adverse climate conditions can negatively affect the financial situation, activities, and performance of the Group. Prices of agricultural products. The Group’s revenue and performance depend on several factors, including the prices of raw materials for agricultural production, which are beyond the Group’s control. Agricultural product prices are strongly influenced by varied factors that are difficult to predict do not dependent on the Group (weather conditions, government policy on agriculture, changes in global demand due to demographic changes, changes in living conditions, competitive products in other countries). Factors such as geopolitical events, climate conditions, infections, pest infestations, national agricultural policies in different countries, and so on, can all have a significant impact on the supply and prices of primary agricultural products. Demand for key agricultural raw materials may be affected by various international and local programmes undertaken under national agricultural policies, as well as by demographic shifts and changes in living conditions in countries worldwide. These factors can cause significant fluctuations in the prices of agricultural products and, therefore, may have a negative impact on the Group’s activities, financial situation and results. Changes in EU subsidies. The Group receives significant revenues from EU subsidies, which is important for the continuity of its activities. If, for any reason, these subsidies were to be terminated or reduced, this could have significant consequences for many of the Group’s activities, including reduction of cash flows and of the profitability of operations, a decrease in the value of land and investment property, and possible drops in the value of the property, facilities, and equipment. Significant changes in EU subsidy programmes could also threaten the long-term continuity of the Group’s activities. Postponement of the strategic projects. The Group currently is in a transition period and several key projects related to the creation of biogas infrastructure, the development of specialised feed technologies, and regenerative crop rotation are crucial for the implementation of the Group’s long-term strategy. In conducting these projects, the Group faces the following risks: insufficient innovation or unsuitability for practical use or market acceptance, lack of skills in project management, and lack of human resources. Liquidity risk. As the Group’s business model requires high working capital, the production cycle in the crop segment is long, and the sales volume of crop products fluctuate during the year, the Group faces significant fluctuations in working capital needs. Increase in land leasing costs. AUGA group leases 87.4% of the farmland it uses. We believe that in the long-term, leasing land instead of owning it allows us to use the available resources more efficiently and ensures a higher return for shareholders. However, an increase in inflation in 2021-2022 has put upward pressure on lease prices. Risk of disease. The Group’s activities involve property of plant and animal origin. Diseases can have a direct impact on the Group’s results, production quantity and quality, and write-offs. Bovine epidemic diseases (such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease) and other diseases, bacteria, etc., can reduce demand for products for fear of possible consequences. Such changes may worsen the Group’s financial situation. This risk is particularly significant for the mushroom segment due to the high concentration of production capacity in one location. Discrepancy between investment amounts and needs. AUGA group is in a transition period during which it needs to ensure the continuance of existing activities as well as the implementation of efficiency programmes and the Group’s long-term strategy. Both areas require investments, the financing of which depends on the Group’s results, the market situation, and other external factors. Increase in production costs. Rising inflation causes the costs of the Group to grow. Fuel, wages, leasing of land and agricultural machinery are significant cost components in the Group’s activities, so it is necessary to control cost growth and compensate for cost increases by increasing efficiency and sales prices. Financing risk. Organic agriculture requires a lot of working capital. If the Group’s borrowed capital reaches a significant level, that could have material consequences, such as: ○ the Group‘s access to additional financing for working capital, investments, acquisitions, debt servicing, etc., could be restricted; ○ the Group‘s flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions could be limited; ○ while certain restrictions in credit agreements relating to business and financial matters are specific to such financing transactions, they can still limit the Group‘s ability to borrow more funds, pledge assets, and/or engage in other types of mergers or transactions, which to a certain extent can limit the possibilities for active development and possibly reduce competitive advantage in the future; ○ possible restrictions on the extension of the maturities of existing financial liabilities. 16 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 2. RESULTS 17 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 2.1. Overall Performance AUGA group, AB and its subsidiaries’ financial results have improved in 2022 when compared to previous year. Rising prices have allowed to cover the increasing costs while more favourable weather conditions and Group’s decisions have led to an improvement in yields. Sales revenue of the Group amounted to EUR 80.09 million in the 12-month period of 2022. This marks a 12% increase on the equivalent period of the year before, when sales revenue was EUR 71.72 million. Revenue has increased in all the segments with the exception of the mushroom segment where revenue decreased by 2% compared to the previous year. The Group's gross profit reached EUR 15.27 million in 2022 and was 286% higher compared to the same period last year (2021), when gross profit amounted to EUR 3.95 million. The Group’s net loss accounted for EUR 5.35 million during the 12 months of 2022, compared to a loss of EUR 15.44 million a year earlier. The Group's EBITDA amounted to EUR 19.58 million in 2022, representing an increase of 115% compared to the previous year, when EBITDA was EUR 9.10 million.

EBITDA margin = EBITDA / Revenues. Operating profit margin = Operating profit (loss) / Revenues. 18 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> Net profit margin = Net profit (loss) / Revenues. ROE = Net profit (loss) / ((Total equity at the end of reporting period + total equity at the beginning of the reporting period)/2). ROA = Net profit (loss) / ((Total assets at the end of reporting period + total assets at the beginning of the reporting period)/2). ROCE = Operating profit (loss) / (Total equity + Non-current and current portion of non-current borrowings and lease liabilities (excluding lease related with IFRS 16)). P/E = Last share price at the end of reporting period / earnings per share. Debt/EBITDA = (Non-current borrowings + non-current obligations under lease + current portion of non-current borrowings + current portion of non-current obligations under lease + current borrowings) / EBITDA. Equity ratio = Total equity / Total assets. Current ratio = Total current assets / Total current liabilities. Adjusted working capital = Current biological assets + Trade receivables, advance payments and other receivables + Inventory – Trade payables – Other payables and current liabilities. The adjusted working capital formula eliminates cash and financing elements allowing the reader to see how well the short-term assets and liabilities directly related to operations of the Group are being utilized. Total current assets and total current liabilities are used to describe current ratio which is also included as a key ratio of the Group. 19 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 2.2. Business Segments 2.2.1. Crop Growing Segment Overview Results of crop growing segment consist of crop harvest fair value, sales of the previous and current year harvest and agricultural subsidies. Harvest in the season of 2021/2022 The total cultivated land area by the Group amounted to 38.5 thousand hectares (ha) in the 2021/2022 season and is slightly less than the cultivated area in the 2020/2021 season. In the 2021/2022 season, 30.1 thousand ha is seeded with crops (30.9 thousand in the 2020/2021 season) out of which 11.7 thousand ha is dedicated to wheat, 6.8 thousand ha to legumes and 11.6 thousand ha to other cash crops. The majority – 10.1 thousand ha out of total 11.7 thousand ha – of wheat will be winter wheat as winter crops usually have higher yield potential compared to summer alternatives. Forage crops comprise 7.7 thousand ha in the 2021/2022 season compared to 6.8 thousand ha in the 2020/2021 season. As of 31 December 2022 the Group has fully completed the harvest of 2021/2022. The gain (loss) on revaluation of agricultural produce was calculated for crops (wheat, legumes and other cash crops) that were harvested by the end of the reporting period. Value of forage crops was based on actual costs. Harvest of 2022/2023 At the end of each quarter the Group evaluates the fair value of crops which have not yet been harvested. The weather conditions during 2022 autumn were favourable for the preparatory work needed for 2022/2023 season. The sowing of winter crops and land tillage work were completed according to schedule. In 2022 there were 17 thous. ha dedicated to winter crops – wheat, rapeseed, clover, barley, rye and vicia – which will be harvested in 2023. This adds up to 52% of land that was sown with wheat, legumes and other cash crops for the 2022/2023 season. For comparison, in 2021/2022 season there was 17.4 thous. ha of winter crops sown. Winter crops are in good condition at the time reporting of financial statements. Based on the Group’s judgement, the mild winter should not have an adverse effect on the upcoming harvest. Favorable conditions in autumn enabled the Group to complete all the necessary land tillage work and prepare the land for the 2023 spring sowing. The Group is well prepared for the 2022/2023 season and is optimistic with regards to the potential of the next year’s harvest. As of 31 December 2022 the group has evaluated the gain (loss) on revaluation of agricultural produce for crops that will be harvested in 2023. The calculation was based on the formula given below: Fair value of the crop = Costs incurred + (Cultivated area in ha * historical average yield as tonnes per ha * forecasted price per tonne – cultivated area in ha * forecasted total cost per ha) * T, where: 11,9 9,0 9,7 8,2 10,4 8,1 12,4 6,8 11,7 6,8 11,6 7,7 5,0 10,0 15,0 Wheat Legumes Other cash crops Forage Crops HA'000 Cultivated land area, thousand ha 2019/2020 2020/2021 2021/2022 5 500 15 600 14 500 15 995 17 404 16 999 19% 53% 51% 51% 58% 52% 0% 20% 40% 60% 5 000 10 000 15 000 20 000 2017/2018 2018/2019 2019/2020 2020/2021 2021/2022 2022/2023 Winter cash crops area and share of total crops Winter cash crops area, ha Winter cash crops share of total area, % 20 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> • Cost incurred is cost actually incurred for a particular crop as of 31 December 2022. • Cultivated area in ha is the area of a particular crop seeded and expected to be harvested. • Historical average yield tonnes per ha. • Forecasted price per tonne. Contracted average sales prices are used for fair value estimation adjusted according to the development in the market. • Forecasted total cost per ha. Average historical cost levels after evaluating the current situation. • T is the portion of time that has already passed from sowing date until the forecasted harvest date expressed as a percentage. As of 31 December 2022, the average completion percentage estimated for next year’s harvest crops was around 34%. (2021 – 37%) The formula discussed above will be used to estimate fair value of cash crops (winter and summer crops) for coming quarters as well until the actual harvest will be completed. Forecasted parameters used in the fair value estimation will be re-evaluated quarterly and adjusted by taking into consideration the most recent data. It should be noted that the fair value of forage crop even at its point of harvest is measured at production cost incurred on forage crop. In other words, forage crop production cost is used as a measure of the fair value of that forage crop since there is no active market for forage crops and there is no reliable data to calculate market price of the forage crops. Due to this the net result on revaluation of forage crops is equal to zero. Table below provides information on land plot of different crops in the seasons 2021/2022, 2020/2021 and 2019/2020. Land plot of wheat and legumes remained stable in the season of 2021/2022 compared to previous period and constituted 61% of all cash crops land plot compared to 60% in the previous season.

It is important to note that the analysis of costs in the 3rd quarter was performed based on the data available at the time. However, after the 4th quarter the group performs a more extensive cost analysis and because of that the final costs have increased.

Cost of wheat has increased in 2022 due to increased land tillage costs and cost of organic fertilizers. While the cost of legumes has increased by 14% when compared to the previous year due to an increase in land tillage costs and seeds. Table below depicts wheat, legume and other crop yields in the current and past two seasons. Wheat yield in 2022 was 3.41 t/ha which is 4% higher than wheat yield in the equivalent period last year. Legumes yield in 2022 increased by 113% compared to previous year from 1.09 t/ha to 2.32 t/ha. Yield of legumes differs significantly over last year due to the heatwave which occurred last summer and caused the decrease of yields. This year the yield of legumes was restored due to favourable weather conditions. However, these conditions were not as favorable to wheat due to the storms with strong winds that occurred in July and flattened part of wheat fields. Nevertheless, the achieved yield of wheat is only slightly better when compared to the 2020/2021 due to the poor yield of summer wheat.

Table below depicts comparison of wheat, legumes and other crops prices at which the harvest was evaluated (at fair value) in the seasons of 2021/2022, 2020/2021 ir 2019/2020. It should be noted that at the time of the publication of the financial statements for the four quarters of 2022, significant part of the 2021/2022 season harvest has already been sold or contracted at fixed prices, therefore fair value of the crops was estimated based on average contract prices.

On the other hand, the weather conditions this year were favourable and allowed the Group to improve its harvest. Increase in costs was compensated with growing prices. The result of legumes was also significantly lower last season when compared to this year. The improved result of legumes is a consequence of a better harvest – the yield of legumes in the 2021/2022 season more than doubled when compared to the previous season.

It should be noted that as of 31 December 2021 Group has already recognised a gain of EUR 2.33 million on the initial recognition of biological assets at fair value for the 2021/2022 season’s crops. Group has also calculated a EUR 1.97 million gain on the initial recognition of biological assets at fair value. Therefore, the total gain on revaluation of biological assets at fair value for the year 2022 is EUR 4.80 million.

In order to assess the results of each segment more precisely, the transactions between segments are executed based on fixed pricing, thus, starting from 2022 such transactions are presented separately and amounted to a EUR 0.68 million loss to the crop growing segment in the I-IV quarters of 2022. Agricultural subsidies and gross profit of the crop growing segment Total amount of agricultural subsidies accrued in 12 months of 2022 was EUR 9.89 million which is similar to the subsidies accrued in the same period in 2021. Accrued subsidies amount is based on calculations according to currently applicable requirements of subsidising programmes regulations. The gross profit of the crop growing segment, encompassing the results of agricultural produce sales, gain (loss) on changes in fair value of biological assets and agricultural subsidies, has improved in 2022 when compared to last year due to the increased gain on revaluation of biological assets at fair value and improving result of sales of agricultural produce.

Dairy Segment Overview The result of the dairy segment in the I-IV quarters of 2022 has improved compared to the same period last year. Rising production prices had the largest effect. Compared to last year the total sales revenue of the dairy segment grew by 21% and reached EUR 16.5 million, while gross profit grew by 202% and reached EUR 2.57 million. Although the number of milked cows changed slightly throughout the year (3,577 as of December 31, 2021, and 3,457 as of December 31, 2022), the amount of sold production decreased by 2% in 2022. The average milk yield, compared to previous year, decreased due to a changed feed ration for cows: due to the poor 2020/2021 season of leguminous crops (protein feed), there was a shortage of feed ingredients, and the quality of feed was affected. With the use of 2021/2022 season crops, the quality of feed and milk yield returned to the level of 2021. In the 12 months of 2022 the average price of milk sold was around EUR 532 per tonne and 28% higher comparing to the same period last year when it was EUR 416 per tonne. The dairy segment’s cost of sales amounted to EUR 14.91 million during the 12 months of 2022 which is 13% more than in the same period last year. A loss of EUR 2.09 million was incurred due to the revaluation of biological assets (animal herd) in 2022. In comparison, the loss due to the revaluation of biological assets (animal herd) was 25% higher last year. In 2022, the Group has recorded a EUR 2.57 million gross profit which marks a threefold increase when compared to the last year. 12-month of 2022 12-month of 2021 12-month of 2020 Variance 2022/2021 Variance 2021/2020, Total quantity of products sold, t 26,594 27,053 26,799 -2% +1% Milk, t 25,334 25,685 25,384 -1% +1% Dairy commodities, t 457 624 714 -27% -13% Cattle, t 803 743 700 +8% +6% Revenue, EUR million 16.50 13.61 12.95 +21% +5% Milk, EUR million 13.48 10.69 10.07 +26% +6% Dairy commodities, EUR million 1.71 2.02 2.13 -15% -5% Cattle, EUR million 1.31 0.90 0.75 +46% +20% Cost of sales, EUR million 14.91 13.15 12.56 +13% +5% Milk, EUR million 11.94 10.36 9.75 +15% +6% Dairy commodities, EUR million 1.66 1.89 2.07 -12% -9% Cattle, EUR million 1.31 0.90 0.75 +46% +20% Revaluation of biological assets, EUR million (2.09) (2.77) (2.52) -25% -10% 21,4 22,0 22,3 22,4 21,1 20,8 20,5 20,6 20,2 20,5 20,7 21,3 22,0 22,1 22,0 22,0 21,9 21,2 21,8 20,6 20,3 20,6 21,6 22,7 22,9 22,5 21,2 20,1 19,9 20,0 19,2 19,5 20,7 21,5 19,0 20,0 21,0 22,0 23,0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Milk yield per cow per day, kg 2020 2021 2022 24 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> Subsidies, EUR million 3.07 3.17 2.53 -3% +25% Gross profit, EUR million 2.57 0.85 0.40 202% +113% 2.2.3. Mushrooms Segment Overview Sales revenues in the mushroom growing segment amounted to EUR 27.90 million in 2022 which marks a decrease of 2% compared to the same period last year. Segment’s gross loss accounted to EUR 1.40 million. The main factor of the negative segment’s result was soaring energy and other costs. The total cost of sales of the mushroom growing segment amounted to EUR 29.30 million in the 12-month period of 2022 and was EUR 1.61 million higher compared to the same period in 2021. Cost of mushrooms mainly has shifted upwards due to growing energy and transportation costs that showed an increase of 65% (EUR 2.30 million) when compared to the corresponding period last year. The average cost of 1 tonne of mushrooms sold increased from 2,294 EUR/tonne to 2,519 EUR/tonne Sales price was increased in order to compensate the growth of costs. In the 12-month period of 2022, the average non-organic and organic mushrooms sales price per tonne, which was equal to EUR 2,384, has increased only by 3% when compared to the equivalent period in 2021. However, excluding transport and taking into account the difference in the product basket the price of mushrooms, in the 4th quarter of 2022 was 16% higher than in the 1st quarter of 2022. The ratio of organic mushrooms sold has increased and reached 7.4% during the 4 quarters of 2022. The same ratio last year was equal to 5.7%. The production volume was not optimal due to savings of energy resources and challenges in production processes. In 2022, 11 thous. tonnes of mushrooms were produced, which is 1% less than in 2021. As a result, the gross result of the segment was negative and for the 12-month period of 2022 amounted to a loss of EUR 1.40 million. Nonetheless, since the energy costs have decreased and stabilised, also, the prices of mushrooms were increased, which resulted in a positive outcome in the 4th quarter of 2022. The gross profit in the last quarter was EUR 78 thousand. When higher production capacities will be reached the Group expects to improve the result of the segment even further. 12-month of 2022 12-month of 2021 12-month of 2020 Variance 2022/2021 Variance 2021/2020, Sold mushrooms, t 11,552 12,002 12,906 -4% -7% Average price (Eur/t) 2,384 2,323 2,199 +3% +6% Total revenue, EUR million 27.90 28.36 30.00 -2% -5% Mushroom sales revenue, EUR million 27.54 27.89 28.38 -1% -2% Compost sales revenue, EUR million 0.36 0.47 1.62 -23% -71% Cost of sale, EUR million (29.30) (27.69) (28.25) +6% -2% Cost of mushrooms sold, EUR million (28.94) (27.45) (26.89) +5% +2% Cost of compost sold, EUR million (0.36) (0.24) (1.36) +50% -82% Gross profit, EUR million (1.40) 0.67 1.75 n/a -62% 3 097 3 081 2 487 2 743 2 857 2 998 2 681 2 709 700 1 200 1 700 2 200 2 700 3 200 3 700 I quarter II quarter III quarter IV quarter Picked mushrooms, t. 2021 2022 25 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 2.2.4. Fast-moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Segment As previously announced, the first half of the year was not very successful for this segment due to various global events. However, the positive breakthrough that occurred in the third quarter carried into the final quarter, with sales returning to target levels and reaching EUR 8.12 million by the end of 2022, an increase of 31% from 2021. In 2022, the segment's gross profit increased to EUR 1.74 million, up from EUR 1.54 million in 2021.The Group had targeted even better results, but there was a delay in price increases associated with rising production costs and in the launch of new products on the market, which prevented the targets from being achieved in 2022, yet the changes already in progress are bound to have a positive impact on the 2023 results.

Even though investments in long-term assets decreased in 2022, but the Group continues to implement planned technological projects. The Group introduced the first biomethane and electricity powered tractor from its first production batch at the beginning of February 2023. Tractors from the first production batch are going to work in the fields in the spring of 2023. In early 2023, the first biomethane infrastructure projects will be completed and biomethane production will begin. Two more biomethane power plants are going to be launched by the third quarter of 2023. The development and testing of specialized feed technology also continues. More information on these projects is presented in the Sustainable report, section Research and Development. 27 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 2.5.

Management of the Group believes that another important factor evaluating financial liabilities level of the Group is net debt adjusted by working capital level. Deducting cash and cash equivalents and adjusted working capital from the level of financial liabilities more clearly indicates the financial liabilities that are not covered by working capital and cash operated by the Group. As of 31 December 2022 the Group’s adjusted working capital was EUR 32.42 million compared to EUR 28.53 million on 31 December 2021. Financial liabilities (excl. IFRS 16 effect) of the Group minus cash and cash equivalents minus adjusted working capital as of 31 December 2022 were EUR 38.43 million or EUR 5.53 million higher than at the end of 2021. 2022 2021 2020 Variance 2022/2021 Variance 2021/2020, Adjusted working capital, EUR thousand 32,424 28,531 41,953 +14% -32% Net debt – adjusted working capital*, EUR thousand 38,428 32,894 15,421 +17% +113% *Adjusted working capital = Current biological assets + Trade receivables, advance payments and other receivables + Inventory – Trade payables – Other payables and current liabilities. The adjusted working capital formula eliminates cash and financing elements allowing the reader to see how the short-term assets and liabilities directly related to operations of the Group are being utilized. This year the difference between net debt and adjusted working capital grew due to the Group’s poor financial results in 2021. Significant increase of costs in 2022 required additional working capital, part of which was financed by loans. 2.6. Cash Flow Rising costs, higher harvest and its sales terms resulted in net cash flows from operating activities for the Group decreasing to 0.69 million euros in 2022.

Summary of 2022 Results and Outlook into 2023 The Group’s financial results have improved significantly in 2022. Agriculture segment had the biggest impact: In 2022, the results of the crop growing segment significantly improved. Timely and proper seeding, favorable weather conditions during the winter season create positive expectations for the 2023 harvest, but there is uncertainty in the markets regarding the level of new harvest prices. Despite the decrease in production volumes, 2022 was a successful year for the dairy segment. Price correction will have a negative impact on the segment's results in 2023, but the Group expects that this will be partly offset by increased yields. Increased costs led to poor mushroom growing segment results in 2022. With energy costs decreasing and stabilizing, and production prices increasing, a positive result was already recorded in Q4 2022. The Group believes that higher production volumes will be achieved in 2023, maintaining the current cost/price level, which will allow significantly improve segment results. The fast moving consumer goods segment maintained its growth trend. The Group expects similar sales growth to be achieved in 2023. Growing activities, better utilisation of production capacity, price review and introduction of new products should have a positive impact on segment‘s profitability growth. 2022 was a successful year in terms of developing and implementing new technologies which will contribute to the achievement of the Group’s Strategy. Successive creation of novel methodologies in the agricultural business, their implementation in actual operations and readiness to further develop such technological solutions will be the Group’s top priority in 2023. Information regarding important events after the end of the financial year is presented in the explanatory notes of the financial statement (note 33).

Governance Model The current corporate governance structure was introduced in 2019, when the Company changed to a one tier board structure instead of a two-tier structure, with the management board taking over the functions of previous supervisory council. Three are three corporate bodies in the Company: the general shareholders’ meeting, the independent board (hereinafter – the Board), the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and an advisory body – the audit committee. The general meeting of shareholders is the supreme body of the Company. The members of the Board are elected by the general meeting in accordance with the procedure established by the Law on Companies of the Republic of Lithuania. The chair of the Board is elected by the Board from its members for two years. The Company does not have an approved diversity policy for the election of the Company's CEO or members of the Board, but the Company has a Human Rights, Non-Discrimination, Child and Forced Labour Policy, which applies to the election of the Company's CEO or members of the Board. The Company's Board is elected taking into account their competences, which would be applicable in the implementation of strategic projects of the entire Group and would cover important areas, such as, for example, the implementation of sustainability, relations with investors, product development and so on. Also, one independent member of the Board is delegated by the second largest shareholder the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The Board also appoints, removes, and supervises the activities of the Company’s CEO, who is in charge of Group’s management and organisation of activities. The Board approves the Sustainability Report of AUGA group, provides comments and insights during the process of its preparation. The members of the audit committee are elected by the Board of the Company from among its members, by a simple majority vote for a two-year term, which coincides with the term of office of the committee members as members of the Board. The Board, considering the complexity of the Company's activities and the level of risk, may decide to increase the number of committee members and/or change its composition. The members of the committee must be of impeccable reputation, appropriate qualifications and experience, collegiately possessing knowledge in the field of finance, accounting, or auditing of financial statements and in the sector, in which the Company operates. The audit committee operates in line with the principles, outlined in the Regulations of audit committee of Company. The audit committee is an advisory body of the Board. The main functions of the audit committee include: ○ monitoring the process of the preparation of the financial statements of the Company, ○ monitoring the audit process of the Company, ○ analysing the effectiveness of internal audit and risk management systems, ○ approving the requirements for external auditors and evaluating both the qualification and the experience of external auditors.

Should there be more than 12 board meetings in 12 months, the indicated remuneration is to be paid for each meeting. Should there be less than 12 meetings per 12 consecutive months, the Board member will nonetheless receive remuneration for 12 meetings per 12 months.

Until 30 April 2019, the Board members were formed out of employees of the Group and they did not receive any remuneration for the performance of Board member functions. Members of the Board who, in addition to their Board member position, served on another position in the Group, received salaries or payments for legal services as a direct remuneration for their employment position within the Group (i.e. the Board included Group’s internal lawyer, CEO). Thus, historical figures are not comparable and do not give a clear overview of governance bodies’ remuneration development.

More information about the Group’s personnel is presented in the AUGA group’s Sustainability Report section 4.4.2. Employees and Diversity. 3.6.3. Employee Share Option Programme The Group runs a share option programme for its specialists and management personnel as an additional motivational tool. On 30 April 2019, during the general meeting of shareholders, the share option programme for employees was approved, and in 2022 the first options were realized, according to the contracts made in 2019. The number of contracts was 167, and the number of shares 2,297,850. The employee options programme provides long-term benefits to employees and increases their motivation. Under the plan, participants are granted options to receive shares of the Company for free, but only if the employee completes a 3-year term of service in the Group. After this condition is met, the employee is eligible to exercise the option. An option loses force if any restructuring, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings concerning the Company are commenced and are ongoing and/or end with liquidation of the Company. It also loses force if both parties (the Company and the receiver) agree to terminate the option agreement or if the receiver has caused damage to the Company through their actions or omissions. These share-based payments to employees are equity-settled only. When exercisable, each option can be convertible into one fully-fledged ordinary share. Such shares are issued from a reserve formed and approved by the shareholders to provide shares for employees, at the nominal value of EUR 0.29, this way increasing the Company’s share capital. Under the programme, options are granted free of charge. Employees, who will exercise their options and receive shares of the Company, must pay income tax at the time of exercise of the option, in accordance with the applicable legislation. Information regarding the share option programme: 2022 2021 2020 Number of participating employees 238 235 221 Number of allocated shares 1,651,185 2,381,701 2,226,830 3.7. Taxes and Regulatory Compliance As specified in the AUGA group’s Code of Business Ethics, the Group complies with all applicable tax laws and strives to ensure that obligations to the state are fulfilled in a transparent, responsible, and timely manner. The Group does not use tax avoidance schemes, and does not work with partners, who use such schemes in their activities. During the reporting period, the Group had no significant violations of legal acts or imposed sanctions that would have a significant impact on the Group, its activities, or the interests of stakeholders.

About the Sustainability Report The Sustainability Report is a review of AUGA group activities, which the Group has been publishing annually since 2017. The latest AUGA group Sustainability Report for 2022 was released in April 2023. Unless specified otherwise, the Sustainability Report for 2022 covers the activities of all the Group’s companies in the period from 1 January until 31 December 2022. To enable comparison and highlight changes in key areas, AUGA group also includes data from previous years. The Sustainability Report for 2022 is part of the Consolidated Annual Report, which is published on the Nasdaq Baltic website and the AUGA group website. Unless otherwise stated, the information contained in this report covers all the Group’s companies. Separate sustainability reports are not prepared for the Group's subsidiaries. AUGA group publishes its activity reports in the form required by regulations for listed companies. Nonetheless, what is first and foremost important for the Group is to seek transparent and fair accountability to its stakeholders. The data presented in the Sustainability Report shall be disclosed in accordance with the principle of materiality. The Sustainability Report for 2022 identifies the key activities and achievements of the Group in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas during the reporting year and the goals expected to be achieved in the future. This report also presents the biennial materiality assessment of AUGA group’s sustainability criteria (the most recent assessment was made in 2021). In preparing its Sustainability Reports, AUGA group follows the Nasdaq ESG Guide and is disclosing its performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. It is important for the Company to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, therefore it follows these principles in its activities and informs of their implementation in the Sustainability Report. It also reports on its progress in implementing the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. In 2022, all information regarding the Group's management is contained in the consolidated report’s section 3. Governance Report to avoid duplication of information, when some information on sustainable governance practices was also included in the Sustainability Report section. Methodological principles were not changed when preparing the report, compared to previous years. The Group's Consolidated Annual Report, which includes the Sustainability Report, complies with the requirements for such reports set forth in the legislation of the Republic of Lithuania and the Communication from European Commission C/2017/4234 Guidelines on Non-Financial Reporting. The report discloses information in accordance with the taxonomy regulation (EU) 2020/852, which establishes a classification system for sustainable economic activities and investments, for the part of the Group's activities to which the regulation applies. AUGA group always strives for consistency and tries to present the publicly released datasets in an informative, convenient, and standard format. Its Sustainability Reports are published annually maintaining a similar structure. In this way, the Group seeks to ensure that all relevant information about the current period and historical data is readily available to its stakeholders. Keen to make the data presented in its Sustainability Report transparent, since 2019 AUGA group has had an audit of its emissions carried out by the independent international company Carbon Footprint. The Group's management has also decided to audit the entire Sustainability Report and has designated a responsible person the head of sustainability to oversee this process. The full Sustainability Report was audited for a second time by an independent consulting company Sustain Advisory in 2022. The contact person responsible for sustainability is Gediminas Judzentas, Marketing and Sustainability Director of AUGA group (g.judzentas@auga.lt).

Our Approach to Sustainability In managing the area of sustainability, AUGA group aims to abide by the best global practices and recommendations envisaged in international sustainability standards. The Group has a sustainability strategy, which it applies across all its companies and activities. AUGA group's management team with an involvement of the Board regularly discusses sustainability goals and achievements. The Group has a sustainability manager, who spearheads AUGA group's sustainability activities and reports it to the CEO. Additionally, one Board member is responsible for overseeing the area of sustainability (from April 2021 to April 2023, this position is held by Michaela Tod). The Group’s sustainability manager submits a sustainability overview to the Board once a year. This review not only presents the Sustainability Report for the past year, but also global sustainability trends, changes in EU and local regulation, consumer research, and practices of other companies. At least twice a year, joint meetings of the Group's sustainability manager and the Board member responsible for sustainability are held, also including the managers of other relevant functional areas, regarding the implementation of the organisation's sustainability strategy. The Group's sustainability strategy is inseparable from stakeholder engagement and ongoing dialogue with them regarding relevant topics. Also, every two years, AUGA group conducts an assessment of what factors are the most important to the Group and its stakeholders. This is done in order to have a positive impact on the most relevant areas. The Group accounts to its stakeholders by annually publishing a Sustainability Report, which is approved by the Board, together with the annual financial statements. An annual Board meeting for reviewing sustainability matters also approves the annual goals and the Board provides feedback to the management regarding sustainability management. To promote transparency and honesty in all its activities, AUGA group has policies in place on good governance, social issues and environmental protection policies. In pursuit of the same goals, the Group also provides activity reports and sustainability data to international initiatives that monitor and supervise sustainable activities. It is a member of a variety of organisations in this area. Procedures for preparing the Sustainability Report along with standards and other principles of sustainability reporting are described in more detail in the section 4.1. About the Sustainability Report. GRI 2-16 GRI 2-14 44 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.2.1. Sustainability Strategy AUGA group's sustainability strategy is an integral part of the Group's business strategy, which is described in more detail in the section 1.4. Strategy. The five-year strategy presented in 2020 is publicly available on the AUGA group website and is consistently being implemented. Sustainability is in the DNA of AUGA group, which it strives to achieve in all three areas of sustainability: social responsibility, sustainable governance and environmental protection, to which it gives particular emphasis. Environmental Protection Although today the Group undertakes organic agriculture and does more in the field of environmental protection than is required by organic farming standards, these measures are not enough to reduce the negative impact of agriculture on the environment. Globally, agriculture is responsible for more than 20% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. As the largest vertically integrated organic food producer in Europe, AUGA group is taking the lead in addressing this sensitive issue. In 2018, the Group set ambitious emission reduction targets (for more details, see section 4.3.4. Greenhouse Gases) and began developing new technologies that will allow us to set the standard for sustainable agriculture and produce food with no cost to nature. The first result of implementing the 2020-2025 strategy was the AUGA M1 prototype of biomethane and electricity-powered tractor for professional use, which was presented in 2021. It can save 100 t of CO2e emissions per year, compared to its fossil-fuelpowered analogues. During 2022, the prototype was prepared for serial production and at the beginning of 2023 the tractor from the first production batch was presented to the public. For more information on advances in AUGA group’s development of technologies for agriculture in 2022, see section 4.3.10. Research and Development. The Group will strive to promote wide adoption of the innovative solutions it creates to allow farmers to work more sustainably, thus creating the opportunity for consumers to choose food with no cost to nature. Social Responsibility Social issues are an important part of the Group's activities. This involves ensuring safety at work as well as gender equality, human rights and non-discrimination, zero tolerance for child or forced labour, and building a dialogue with the communities in the places where the Group's companies operate. Sustainable Governance The Group also follows good governance practices through an independent Board model and seeks to ensure transparency to investors and other stakeholders. Through its sustainable strategy, AUGA group pursues the following results for these main target groups: CONSUMERS FARMERS PRIVATE AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SHAREHOLDERS a more sustainable way to eat a more sustainable way to work a more sustainable way to invest a more sustainable way to receive financial returns 45 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.2.2. UN Sustainable Development Goals Based on the nature of AUGA group’s activities, the Group aims to contribute to the seven UN Sustainable Development Goals. The list was last updated in 2019. AUGA group has integrated these UN Sustainable Development Goals: Healthy and affordable food Food labelling, safety, and prices Sustainable sourcing Genetic diversity of farmed and domesticated animals Labour practices in the supply chain Occupational health and safety Access to medicines Access to quality essential health care services Air quality Water quality Employment Non-discrimination Capacity building Availability of a skilled workforce Elimination of forced or compulsory labour Infrastructure investments Access to financial services Environmental investments Research and development Sustainable sourcing Resource efficiency of products and services Materials recycling Procurement practices Product and services information and labelling Energy efficiency Environmental investments GHG emissions Risks and reduction opportunities due to climate change Deforestation and forest degradation Genetic diversity of farms and domesticated animals Land remediation Landscapes forest management and fibre sourcing Natural ecosystems Water ecosystems 46 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.2.3. Stakeholders and Materiality Assessment of Sustainability Criteria A close and high-quality dialogue with stakeholders is an important task of AUGA group. Relevant stakeholder groups are identified by the management team, based on the type and scale of their activities and overall business needs. Cooperation with these groups allows to respond to their needs and pursue a positive impact on various areas. The Group's named stakeholders, main topics and forms of dialogue with them are presented in the table below.

Every two years the Group conducts a materiality assessment of sustainability criteria among its stakeholders, AUGA group managers and Board members. An anonymous survey is used to determine the significance of the key sustainability criteria for all the listed groups. In 2021, for the third time the Company has assessed the significance of sustainability criteria. Considering the current market conditions, AUGA group revised the previously applied sustainability criteria and added several new ones. For example: preservation of biodiversity, land, air, water pollution, involvement in social activities and others. More information on the evaluation and individual stakeholder‘s data can be found in the 2021 Sustainability Report, which is published on the AUGA group website. A new assessment will be carried out in 2023. GRI 2-29 GRI 2-12 47 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> Matrix of Sustainability Criteria Significance The survey data shows that emissions reduction is one of the highest priorities for both AUGA group management and its stakeholders. Other environmental aspects, which include soil health, responsible use of natural resources, renewable energy, land, air, water pollution, are also important for all stakeholders and businesses. In this assessment, animal welfare and the newly added biodiversity criterion are also given top priority by stakeholders. The Group pays great attention to the topic of biodiversity, which is included in the Environmental Protection procedure, and cooperates with local universities in order to introduce and improve good practices for biodiversity conservation. The Group is consistently investing in the living conditions of livestock farms and this programme will continue in line with the approved Animal Welfare Policy. In the opinion of the interviewed public groups and managers, the most important criteria in the social field are safety, health of employees, fair remuneration and food safety. Responding to this priority, the Group operates an Employee Safety and Health System, employees are provided with additional health insurance. Food safety has always been and remains a daily priority both in our own and outsourced production, the Group's organisational structure includes employees responsible for this. Sincere payment of taxes, work ethics, application of anti-corruption principles are the main criteria in the field of management, which were distinguished by the surveyed parties. This is supported by the management of AUGA group. In order to meet the expectations of stakeholders, the Group will continue to adhere to the principles established in the code of business ethics and other policies.

Policies AUGA group has seven policies that create conditions for fair and transparent relations with all stakeholders, ensure mechanisms for safe work and help protect employees and Board members from various types of discrimination. The Group's policies and business ethics code are based on good corporate practices and principles that comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Resolution on Business and Human Rights, the main conventions of the International Labour Organization, other international accords and the legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania. All the policies are publicly available on the AUGA group website. Policies are reviewed at the beginning of each year or more frequently, if needed. Designated managers, who oversee the relevant areas of activity, are responsible for implementation of policies. Policy changes are approved by the Board. Employees’ and suppliers’ knowledge regarding current policies is updated annually. The Group has an approved process for the required submission to the Board of an annual report on the implementation of policies and recorded complaints for the past year no later than before the Company's ordinary general meeting of shareholders of the corresponding year. All the policies apply to the employees of AUGA group and the members of its management bodies, including the members of the Board and audit committee. Employees, who notice situations in which valid policy guidelines are violated, can anonymously report them to e-mail: etika@auga.lt. In 2022, no complaints were received or violations recorded regarding any policies approved by the Group. The Group does not have uniform procedures for dealing with all complaints or negative impacts. When necessary, it is dealt with following general internal procedures and in compliance with the requirements of the law of the Republic of Lithuania. In 2022, all new employees (395 or 100%) were introduced to the policies. Employees of the Group's administration, managers and specialists with e-mail access (303 or 25%) refreshed their knowledge of the policies via online system.

Sustainability Commitments and Data Disclosure on International Platforms In 2021, the Group became an official member of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. It thus committed to reporting annually on compliance with the 10 main principles of the international compact and to setting even more ambitious goals for the implementation of a sustainable food value chain. AUGA group’s goal of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated in its activities by 27% by 2025 was audited by international experts. It was determined that the Group's goal is in line with the Science Based Targets, for stopping global warming at 1.5°C. The Group is keen to ensure that information on its sustainability performance is available to its investors and other stakeholders, and that its sustainability indicators are comparable to those of other companies. For this reason, AUGA group provides its environmental, social and governance information to the international environmental data disclosure platform CDP, the Nasdaq ESG Data Portal, and the international sustainability rating company ISS ESG. In 2022, the Group improved its rating on CDP platform to a C. Also, in 2022, ISS ESG gave the Group a C+ rating, placing it among the top 10% the world's most sustainable companies in the food and beverage sector. The Group thus maintained this rating for a third consecutive year. 4.2.6. Memberships and Partnerships Participation in the activities of associations, sharing best practices and solving emerging problems in the field of sustainability is important for AUGA group. Therefore, for a number of years, the Group has been a member of the following organizations: the Lithuanian Association of Agricultural Companies (LŽŪBA), the Lithuanian Organic Farmers Association (LEŪA), the Responsible Business Association of Lithuania (LAVA) and the Baltic Institute of Corporate Governance (BICG). Baltic Champs, which is part of the Group, is a member of the Lithuanian Association of Mushroom Growers and Processors (LGAPA), and AUGA Luganta belongs to the Lithuanian Vegetable Growers Association. In order to educate young professionals on various sustainability issues and to improve its image as an attractive employer, the Group has repeatedly partnered with various educational institutions. AUGA group cooperates with the following Lithuanian universities: VMU Academy of Agriculture, Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), LSMU Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kaunas College, Vilnius Business College, and ISM University of Management and Economics. Associations and Organisations: Universities and Colleges: GRI 2-28 50 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.2.7. Taxonomy Overview The Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 with its implementing legislation establishes a classification system for sustainable economic activities and investments. It defines activities that are considered to significantly contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives, and thereby contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal. Companies are required to disclose what portion of their operations are sustainable as measured by revenue, CAPEX (investments) and OPEX (operating expenses). This system aims to ensure transparency for stakeholders: shareholders, investors, etc. While preparing the report for 2022, an assessment was made regarding which of the Group's economic activities are eligible for the Taxonomy and which of these activities that fall under the Taxonomy align with the requirements for sustainable activities. In the current version of the Taxonomy Regulation and delegated acts, agricultural and food production activities are not included or classified. Therefore, although the Group is engaged in organic farming and applies the principles of sustainable farming, it cannot yet state, which main activities of the Group meet the requirements of the Taxonomy. Revealing this compliance will be possible after the European Commission prepares the relevant technical screening criteria for agriculture and food production. Part of other economic activities relevant to the Group, which are currently subject to Taxonomy classification and may be assessed for compliance with the Taxonomy's sustainability criteria, include: ○ Construction of new buildings, ○ Renovation of existing buildings, ○ Electricity generation using solar power, ○ Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, ○ Road freight transport, ○ Research and development activities. None of the activities listed above are commercial activities of the Group that generate sales. Therefore, in terms of revenue, the application and compliance with the Taxonomy criteria is equal to 0%. The same is to be said with regard to OPEX. CAPEX for these activities in 2022 amounted to EUR 8.774 million, i.e., 94.9% of total CAPEX. The activities were also assessed for compliance with the sustainability criteria of the Taxonomy Regulation according to the following rules: ○ whether the activity significantly contributes to one of the six envisaged environmental objectives ○ whether it does no significant harm to other environmental objectives, ○ whether the activity complies with social protection minimums. The criteria are met by the Group's research and development activities, whose CAPEX in 2022 amounted to EUR 4.077 million and accounted for 44.1% of the total CAPEX. The aim of these activities is to create applicable technological solutions that will significantly contribute to one of the most important environmental goals climate change mitigation in agriculture. These activities cause no significant harm to the other five environmental objectives, and they meet the standards of social protection. They are therefore assessed as meeting the Taxonomy's sustainability criteria. The compliance of the Group's revenue, OPEX and CAPEX with the Taxonomy's application and compliance criteria is presented in the following graphs: OPEX Turnover EUR 13.1 million CAPEX EUR 9.2 million □ Non-elligible □ Elligible Alligned 100% EUR 80.1 million 5.1% 94.9% 44.1% 100% 51 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.3.

Organic Farming and Sustainability Practices AUGA group has started to systematically reduce the environmental impact of its core activities since 2015, when it made a strategic decision to turn from conventional agriculture to organic farming and began transforming all of its farms established in various regions of Lithuania. AUGA group thus introduced production methods that allow to reduce the agricultural footprint on the environment, protects the fields and final products from pesticides and other chemicals, meanwhile gives consumers an opportunity to eat more environmentally friendly and healthier food. The transformation process was completed in 2017. Since then, AUGA group operates entirely on organically certified land, and the newly added areas which are not organically certified, are also being converted to organic farming. The main differences between organic and conventional farming are the following: ○ In organic farming, no pesticides or other chemicals are used, only natural fertilisers are allowed. ○ Proper soil preparation and conservation of biodiversity are essential, soil must be improved through crop rotation. Natural fertilisation and crop rotation ensure soil fertility and erosion resistance. It is important to note that today AUGA group, by developing organic farming, does more than is currently required by EU organic regulations: ○ Min-till technologies. While using such technologies, only the surface layer of the soil is being cultivated. This protects the soil from erosion, allows to preserve the fertile soil layer, the microorganisms contained in it and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. ○ Green energy. Farms and all AUGA group companies use only certified green electricity. Part of the energy from renewable sources is produced internally by the Group. ○ Regenerative crop-rotation. According to the crop rotation plan, at least 4 different crops are grown in 7 years. This improves the soil and is good for biodiversity. Annually increasing areas of perennial grasses and leguminous crops makes it possible to reduce the need for organic fertilisers and emissions in crop production. ○ More sustainable animal husbandry. In order to ensure the well-being of animals, they have the opportunity to go outside in AUGA group farms all year round, and graze in the pastures during summer. Cow feed is based on perennial leguminous grasses, which is a more sustainable, less emission-generating feed, compared to commonly used grains, corn silage or soybeans. ○ A closed-loop organic farming method. Synergy between different branches of agriculture and secondary utilisation of organic waste is ensured. Raw materials (fodder crops) grown in the crop segment are used as an animal feed, and straw is used to produce mushroom compost. In the dairy segment, the organic waste (manure) generated from its activities is used as fertiliser in crop production and in the mushroom growing segment to produce compost. From 2023 the manure will be used for biomethane production. 54 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.3.3. Biodiversity Biodiversity is one of the key environmental objectives of AUGA group's Environmental Policy. Through its agricultural activities, the Group can have a direct impact on the environment, living organisms, and ecosystems, and plays a vital role in their conservation. AUGA group aims to protect and improve biodiversity in the following ways: ○ In its activities and organic production fields, it does not use chemical pesticides or other chemical plant protection products. The Group seeks to engage exclusively in organic farming and to convert all newly added land to organic production. ○ In its activities it uses only the organic fertilisers and gradually reduces the need for them through crop rotation and the increasing of areas with leguminous grasses, which are capable of nitrogen fixation and carbo capture. ○ Applies a regenerative crop rotation plan with at least four different crops cultivated over seven years. ○ Where organic fertilisers are used, the Group works to minimise the leaching of fertilisers into water bodies. It does so by applying fertiliser only at specified times, maintaining buffer zones for water bodies and applying all organic fertilisers used to the soil at once. ○ It leaves the established buffer zones for drainage ditches and water bodies and carries out their extensive maintenance. ○ It aims to maximise the use of min-till farming technology. ○ It seeks to allocate at least 30-50% of the area in crop rotation to flowering plants (legumes and grasses) that are beneficial to pollinators and cooperates with beekeepers by establishing mobile apiaries near flowering fields. ○ In the winter season, the Group leaves at least 50% of the farmland under agricultural crops, catch crops or plant residues, which are beneficial to soil and terrestrial fauna. ○ To prevent eutrophication* and deterioration of natural aquatic ecosystems, mixtures of at least three different types of plants are selected for catch crops, based on radish or brown mustard, which retain the most excess of nitrogen. ○ Part of grain crops are grown with silage (fodder grasses) in order to enrich the soil with biological nitrogen and organic matter, which, while slowly decomposing, provides food for the biodiversity of soil and increases the amount of sequestered carbon. ○ In the fields that fall into the protected areas, perennial meadows or pastures are left, the number of grazing animals is limited and the existing hydrological regime is maintained. ○ The roots of individual trees growing in the fields are protected at the canopy** perimeter. Such trees perform an important stepping-stone function between larger suitable habitats. Insects and fungal spores that have settled in such a place can later spread further to another area. ○ The Group fights climate change that is harmful for biodiversity by developing and implementing GHG emission reduction technologies in agriculture. ○ The Group is committed to engaging in research, conservation and education activities, and collaborating on biodiversity issues with universities, governmental and non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders. * Eutrophication is an increase in the biological productivity of a water body due to an increased supply of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) compounds. ** The tree protection zone is the territory that involves the projection of the canopy on the ground, where the roots and the canopy of the tree are protected. To ensure the protection of biological diversity on the lands managed by the Group, accounting is planned to identify territories of high natural value for farming and the species present in them. It is a complex and time-consuming task, as there are 664 protected areas of European importance in Lithuania alone. Different plant and animal species and habitats are protected in them. In addition, important changes in legislation related to agriculture and biodiversity are expected this year, implementation of which will already be reflected in next year's land declaration. By identifying what we need to protect, we will be able to expand the measures currently in place and adapt farming practices in ways that do not endanger habitats or species ranges, thus helping to preserve the diversity of ecosystems even more. Data collection has started and will be completed in 2023. GRI 304-1 55 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.3.4. Greenhouse Gases CO2e Reduction Goals by 2025 from 2019 Bases: 27% 50% 50% 30% less total Group emissions (base 72,821 t CO2e) less emissions from diesel fuel used for farm work (base 16,646 t CO2e) less emissions per ton of milk produced (base 0.68 t CO2e) less emissions per ton of dry matter of crop production (base 0.37 t CO2e) Direct and Indirect Emissions The calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated in the Group is based on the generally accepted international methodology. Operational emissions are classified into three groups: direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), other sources (Scope 3). The symbol CO2e notes CO2 and the emissions of other greenhouse gases converted to its equivalent using the standard coefficients. Emissions, t CO2e* 2022 2021 2020 Scope 1 62,495 61,727 66,144 Scope 2 8 9 6 Scope 3 4,961 2,414 1,983 Total: 67,463 64,150 68,133 *Calculated using the "market-based method", evaluating based on actual electricity purchases. When calculated using the "location-based method", i.e. according to the country-specific nature of energy production, the Group's total GHG emissions in 2022 would be 70,722 t CO2e. During the reporting period, greenhouse gas emissions from the Group's activities increased by 3,313 t CO2 e or by 5.2% compared to the previous year, however, in 2022 emissions decreased by 5,358 t CO2 e or by 7.4%, compared to the base year 2019. Comparing year 2022 with 2019, Scope 1 decreased by 8,519 t CO2 e, Scope 2 constitutes a small part of the emissions and changed only slightly, and Scope 3 increased by 3,160 t CO2 e due to extended accounting. A larger footprint was recorded for AUGA group’s activity in 2022 due to higher yields in the crop production segment (resulting in higher emissions from crop residues left in the fields) and an increased number of livestock (higher emissions from internal fermentation processes and manure management). In addition, the larger volume of products sold led to higher emissions from packaging. The amount of electricity and water used in operations decreased, along with the emissions by 11% and 18% respectively. Gas emissions from the use of refrigeration equipment decreased by remarkable 62%, as fewer leaks and system refills were recorded. AUGA group’s biggest sources of GHG emissions were cattle digestion processes, the use of fossil fuels in farm activities and soil emissions, resulting from organic fertilisers and crop residues. This situation has been similar for several years in a row.

A significant change for the largest sources of emissions should occur over the next two years with the development of new technologies and their use in the Group's activities during the next two years. Crop rotation related to future fodder production continues to be developed, consistently increasing the area of leguminous grass crops (to 8,811 ha in 2022, which is 12% more than in 2021), thereby reducing the need for fertilisers and emissions. The Group purchases and uses green electricity in its operations. This decision, at the level of the entire Group, allowed to save as much as 3,017 t of CO2 e in 2022. The calculation of Group‘s emissions include not only CO2, but also CH4, N2O and HFCs gases converted into CO2 equivalent using the standard coefficients and marking the final total number as CO2e. PFCs, SF6, and NF3 gases are not emitted in the Group's activities. AUGA group calculates emissions of nitrogen suboxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) separately, converted into kilograms, as recommended by international standards (GRI). N2O, like oxygen and carbon, is necessary for crop production. Although nitrogen gas makes up 75% of the earth's atmosphere, it is difficult to absorb it directly from the air, therefore fertilisers (liquid or solid manure), that are saturated with this element, are used in agriculture. Due to fertilising, manure management and the decomposition of crop residues in the fields during AUGA group’s activities in 2022, 90,282 kg of N2O was released. Methane (CH4) is generated through the animal husbandry activities from the digestive processes of cattle and management of manure. In 2022, 665,368 kg of CH4 emissions were recorded. The direct emissions calculated in Scope 1 also include biogenic emissions from existing biomass (manure and crop residues in fields). This includes direct emissions of N2O from soil, indirect volatilisation of N2O from soil, and leaching of N2O from soil. The total number of these biogenic emissions in 2022, converted into CO2 equivalents, totalled 22,599 t CO2e. Biogenic emissions from burning biofuels for heating (e.g., firewood) are not specific and thus are not included. Indicators of Emission Intensity The indicators of GHG emissions intensity are calculated by dividing up the annual emissions by the various units of economic activity. They show the amount of CO2 emitted in the operations of the Group through the financial, production, arable land and other units. When calculating emissions per euro of revenue and per 1 employee, all Group emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3 are included. When calculating emissions per cattle and per tonne of milk, per hectare and tonne of crop production, and per tonne of mushroom production, only Scope 1 and 2 emissions are included, assigned to the relevant activity segment animal husbandry, crop production or mushroom cultivation. Emissions, t CO2e 2022 2021 2020 t CO2e / 1 million EUR of revenue 842.36 893.70 818.07 t CO2e / 1 employee 55.03 52.03 53.61 t CO2e / 1 cow 3.13 3.20 3.05 t CO2e / t ECM milk* 0.76 0.73 0.67 t CO2e / ha 0.89 0.85 0.91 t CO2e / t crop production 0.37 0.46 0.31 t CO2e / t mushroom production 0.24 0.30 0.30 *Energy corrected milk (ECM) is a relative unit of measurement of milk. It converts an amount of raw milk to the equivalent quantity of “corrected” milk with 4.0% fat and 3.3% protein. The biggest change is seen in the relative ratio of emissions to income. Although in 2022 both emissions and income grew, their ratio decreased by 5.6%, compared to 2021. Another indicator, emissions per crop production unit, also shows a significant change. The number is down due to a higher yield grown during the season, which, while growing, used lower quantities of organic fertilisers and fossil fuels, compared to previous years. Emissions per cattle decreased due to a larger number of cattle raised and decreases in both the use of fossil fuel and gas for refrigeration. The figure for emissions per 1 tonne of milk produced was influenced by the increased number of cattle, out of which 46% of new cattle were heifers and bulls that do not produce milk but contribute to the generation of emissions. GRI 305-4 GRI 305-3 GRI 305-1 Nasdaq A2 57 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> In the table, which indicates the intensity of GHG emissions, the most important lines are highlighted. They reflect AUGA group's strategy for emission reduction by 2025. The achievement of these goals is planned to be achieved after the implementation of the main technology projects: specialised fodder technology, related crop rotation, and switching from the use of fossil fuels on farms to biomethane. Methodology The emission calculations and results obtained in this report are presented based on the GHG protocol, the methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an audit performed by the consulting company "Carbon Footprint". Emission factors from the following sources were used for the calculation: Lithuania 2022 National Inventory Report, Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) 2021, UK Government Conversion Factors for greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting, 2022. Direct emissions (Scope 1) include all sources controlled by the Group while undertaking its activities. Indirect emissions (Scope 2) are generated from the energy that the Group buys from other suppliers (it does not produce it itself). Other sources (Scope 3) include indirect emissions that were not included in the calculations of the first two groups but are directly related to the Group's activities. AUGA group defines the systematic limits of life cycle assessment from cradle-to-gate, i.e., it calculates operational GHG emissions from resource extraction to realisation (sale) of the company's production. Based on to data availability, its completeness, and its importance for the activity, AUGA group chose to include the following data in the calculation of emissions from other sources (Scope 3): water, electricity and heating transmission losses, paper for office use, packaging, waste and business trips. For several years the emissions of the Group's activities have been audited by the independent company “Carbon Footprint”, one of the leading CO2 footprint auditors. With the independent audit, the Group seeks to declare to its stakeholders that the information it publishes is reliable and transparent. Life Cycle Assessment of Products In 2022, commissioned by the Group, Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) researchers conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the carbon footprint (CO2e) of AUGA-brand packaged food products for final consumption, covering all processes from the cultivation of raw materials to transportation, production of the final product and packing. The research was carried out in accordance with the product life cycle assessment, carbon footprint evaluation standards and other documents. The aim of the project was to understand all the main processes in the life cycle of the products and to determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by each of them. Data for 2021 was used for the research. This research is important as a starting point for assessing future emission reductions when applying agricultural technologies developed by the AUGA group that address the largest sources of emissions. Several products representing different categories and produced from the Group's own organic raw materials grown on its farms were selected for evaluation: 2.5% and 3.5% fat milk in 1 l packages, carrots and potatoes in 1 kg packages, and universal wheat flour in 2 kg packages. The data below regarding flour is calculated per 1 kg. 58 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 0.13 0.010.01 *Secondary products (bran and feed flour) generated during the flour production process have negative emissions from the point of view of life cycle assessment. The study found that largest amounts of the emissions for the product groups examined occur in the production of raw materials on farms – crops and livestock. Cattle internal fermentation, manure management, diesel used on the farm and organic fertilisers generate most of the emissions. Processing and packaging account for a relatively smaller share of emissions. Among the products studied, the results show that milk generates the most emissions 1.54 kg CO2e per 1 litre of product. This is due to high emissions from the internal fermentation processes of cattle and manure management (38% of emissions). Wheat flour (with 0.34 kg CO2e per 1 kg of product) stands out with high emissions from the use of organic fertilisers (86% of emissions). Total emissions of this product are reduced by the fact that some secondary products formed in the production process, namely bran and feed flour, have negative emissions from the point of view of life cycle assessment. Vegetables, in particular carrots, have the lowest impact on the environment (0.15 kg CO2e per 1 kg of product). The largest part of pollution comes from the use of diesel fuel during cultivation (87% of emissions). Mushroom compost used as fertiliser has negative emissions from the point of view of life cycle assessment, as it is a product of secondary use. To evaluate the base emissions of AUGA products, with the help of KTU researchers, we compared them to the average products in the corresponding categories on the European market. The calculations showed that 1 litre of AUGA organic milk generates about 14% less emissions compared to the average product on the market with the same fat content. AUGA organic wheat flour emissions are just half the market average. AUGA organic potatoes generate 46% less emissions per kilogram than same amount of conventional potatoes. Meanwhile, the difference in emissions for AUGA organic carrots is smaller, at 8% less than the market average. While the assessment based on 2021 data found that AUGA products already involved less emissions than corresponding average products on the market, those results were not yet affected by new technologies the Group is developing, such as agricultural machinery that does not use diesel, and specialised emission-reducing feed technology. The implementation of these projects should reduce the impact of AUGA products on the environment even further, to help reach the goal of "no cost to nature". 0.59 0.42 0.24 0.15 0.10 3.5% fat AUGA milk 1 l 1.54 kg CO2e AUGA carrots 1 kg 0.15 kg CO2e AUGA wheat flour 1 kg Product emission composition, kg CO2e AUGA wheat flour 1 kg GRI 305-4 AUGA wheat flour 1 kg □ Livestock and manure handling emissions □ Use of diesel fuel □ Organic fertilisers □ Packaging □ Other Production 0.29 0.12 -0.14 0.010.05 0.34 kg CO2e 59 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.3.5.

During the reporting period, AUGA group consumed 19,533 gigajoules (GJ) of energy, or 5% less than in 2021. Lower total energy consumption in 2022 mainly resulted from the decreased use of natural and liquefied gas (23% and 12% less, respectively), with electricity consumption also down by 11%. AUGA group does not sell any type of energy. The use of diesel fuel for transport can be seen to be decreasing noticeably every year. While 7,360 thousand litres were used in 2019, only 6,855 thousand litres were used in 2022. Changes in cultivated crops were the main factor in this – especially the increased area for grasses and seed clover, which require significantly less maintenance than grain or vegetable crops. Additionally, equipment is being made more efficient. In recent years, lighter seed drills have been used, which consume less fuel and sow larger areas in each outing. AUGA group owns many companies engaged in various areas. Due to their different nature, the Group has no centralised rules on reducing energy consumption. Each company independently implements energy saving initiatives according to the nature of its activity. Energy consumed outside the Group's operations and in the supply chain (upstream, downstream) is not calculated due to lack of data. GRI 302-4 Nasdaq A5 Nasdaq A3 60 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> Intensity of Energy Consumption Energy consumption intensity indicators are calculated by dividing annual energy consumption by the units of economic activity. They show how much energy is used to carry out a particular activity. AUGA group calculates energy intensity for financial, production, arable land and other units. Energy intensity calculations include direct and indirect energy types. Calculations per head of cattle, per tonne of milk, per hectare or per tonne of mushroom production use the energy consumption allocated to the relevant activity segment animal husbandry, crop growing or mushroom cultivation.

It converts an amount of raw milk production to the equivalent quantity of “corrected” milk with 4.0% fat and 3.3% protein. Energy consumption per unit of crop and mushroom production decreased in 2022 due to higher crop yield and lower use of natural gas and electricity use in the mushroom sector. The rate per hectare decreased due to lower use of fossil fuels for crop production. There is a visible increase in the reporting period for livestock-related indicators, in terms of energy use per unit of milk and cattle. The change was caused by the increased consumption of fuel and electricity attributed to animal husbandry activities, as well as the increased number of cattle, with 46% of the increase involving heifers and bulls, which do not produce milk but do generate emissions. 4.3.6. Water AUGA group's operations in the agricultural sector require the consumption of a significant volume water for growing crops and mushrooms, watering animals and preparing products for final consumption. The water for ensuring production processes is taken from wells located at agricultural companies or centralised municipality water supplies. Consumption is monitored using water metres. It is important to note that the Group monitors the environmental impact of water consumption through CO2e emissions. 2022 2021 2020 Water, m3 300,782 368,867 338,913 During the reporting period, AUGA group consumed less water compared to previous year by 68,085 m3 or by 18.5%. Such change was mainly due to the sufficient amount of precipitation in 2022 when, unlike in previous years, there was little need to additionally irrigate crops. Secondary water utilisation practices are used in the mushroom cultivation segment, where growing mushrooms, the water required for compost production is used several times. Excess unabsorbed water is collected and reused until almost all water leaves together with the mushroom compost produced. Water is also saved in the production of final products. Thus, for example, the same water is circulated for several cycles during the treatment of mushrooms at high temperatures in an autoclave. AUGA group does not have an approved water reduction or reclaiming policy across the companies of the Group. Each company belonging to AUGA group independently implements water saving and reuse initiatives according to the nature of its activities. Water is not used from areas that face water shortages.

Waste AUGA group understands that in order to be sustainable, it needs not only to create innovations to eliminate the environmental impact of agriculture, but also to take care of waste generated in its operations. AUGA group strives to manage as much of the waste it generates as possible following the principle ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’. To ensure enhanced control of waste management and make the process clearer, in 2021 AUGA group developed waste generation, storage and disposal procedures, which have since been implemented in all Company’s farming operations. The procedures are internal rules of the company which are not approved at the Board level as the Group's waste management policy. Based on those procedures, the Group's companies that engage in farming comply with regulations for waste storage and management in Lithuania: generated waste is sorted and accounted for with the national GPAIS system, ensuring it is transferred only to companies (waste handlers) with permits to manage it. To ensure circularity, the Group's agricultural companies use the organic waste they generate in their farming activities, and what cannot be used is passed on to the waste managers who use it to produce energy.

In 2022, the Group's activities generated less waste than the previous year by 355 tonnes or by 26%. The change mainly reflects a decrease in organic waste due to increased composting on farms. A reduction of plastic waste is also visible as more sustainable practices spread among the Group's companies: paper packaging is chosen more often and products are purchased in larger quantities instead of small packages. Waste sorting and recycling has always been an important task to the Group. Thus, AUGA group constantly educates its employees about proper waste sorting in various ways, for example with information on the intranet, on notice boards, and near the recycling bins. GRI 306-3 GRI 306-2 GRI 306-1 62 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.3.8. Environmental Management Environmental protection is a top priority for AUGA group, which for that reason abides by an Environmental Protection Policy and Environmental Management System. The Group's Environmental Policy, which was approved in 2019 and updated in 2021, sets out guidelines and principles to ensure the management of AUGA group’s environmental impact throughout its business cycle. It stipulates that the Group shall: ○ Operate in compliance with all mandatory requirements of environmental legislation. ○ Cooperate with business partners, public authorities and institutions on environmental issues. ○ Monitor its environmental impacts, in particular by calculating the organisation's carbon footprint, use of natural and energy resources, and waste generation. ○ Conserve natural and energy resources: develop a closed-loop organic farming method, apply min-till farming technologies, and use renewable energy sources. ○ Create and implement technologies to reduce the Group‘s GHG emissions in three key areas: the use of fossil fuel, soil cultivation and cattle digestion processes. ○ Manage as much waste generated at the Company as possible in line with the reduce, reuse and recycle principle. ○ Develop employees’ competences and sense of responsibility for environmental protection. The Group's environmental management system has been in force since 2020. It stipulates that environmental control and improvement procedures within the Group, such as annual audits, discussions of the results by management of the Group, and identification of risks and corrective actions. It is a framework for managing the Group's environmental impact and risks in all key business processes. Inspections carried out on farms in 2022 closely examined compliance with the law on waste management (storage, sorting, marking, accounting). In its environmental activities, AUGA group adheres to the ‘precautionary principle’. 4.3.9. Climate Change Oversight In 2020, AUGA group formulated its innovation agenda laying down clear emission reduction targets and measures to achieve them. The Group has set to reduce its emissions by 27% by 2025 and become a climate-neutral market player by 2030. For the Group to achieve these climate targets, it is essential to periodically review ongoing projects, monitor the process and track the results. AUGA group holds quarterly management reviews of the major projects, including biogas infrastructure and biogas-powered vehicles, the development of specialised feed, and the use of regenerative crop rotation. These meetings discuss the projects progress, challenges and achievements, planned investments and budgets. Such regular reviews allow the Group to quickly address challenges and take decisions that facilitate the achievement of the key strategic objectives. AUGA group also organises semi-annual reviews of these projects at the Board meetings. The progress of the innovation agenda, current challenges and results are introduced to the highest governing body of the AUGA group. Involving the Board in the development of these projects allows improving the management of environmental risks and making the right decisions to achieve the desired results. These reviews of innovation projects have been held together with the Board since 2020, and this tested practice will be continued to be followed.

Research and Development The main goal of AUGA group's Research and Development (R&D) Department is to develop and implement innovative agricultural technologies that purify operational efficiency and enable activities with a lower negative climate impact. In 2022 the Group allocated EUR 4.077 million for the implementation of technological projects.This sum increased by 57% compared to EUR 2.592 million in the previous year. Biogas Purification and Application Technologies The long-term goal of AUGA group is to achieve climate-neutral food growing processes through technology. One of the key areas of AUGA group's innovation agenda is to ensure that fossil fuels in farm vehicles will be replaced with biomethane, which is produced from agricultural waste generated in other segments of the Group. For this reason, AUGA group is investing in technologies that purifies biogas into biomethane. In 2021, AUGA group, together with experienced partners (scientific and business institutions), implemented an R&D project, aimed to improve the efficiency indicators of biogas cleaning technology. The R&D project was part-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the Operational Programme for EU Structural Funds Investments for 2014-2020, priority axis 1 'Strengthening Research and Development and Innovation', Implementing Measure No. J05-LVPA-K 'Intelligence'. The total value of the project is EUR 0.86 million. The logical follow-up of the development of sustainable gas technologies is the creation of a real-scale prototype laboratory. The Biopower Plants Development Cluster, in which AUGA group participates, has decided to initiate the project "Research Laboratory for the Application of Biomethane Concentration Enhancement Methods in Large-Scale Anaerobic Digesters“. During the implementation of the project in 2022, complex laboratory equipment was purchased for R&D activities. While using the laboratory equipment acquired during the project, competitive technological solutions are planned to be created and offered on a global scale. The project is financed by European Union Structural Funds. The value of the project amounts to EUR 1.88 million (incl. VAT), out of which EUR 1.22 million is financed from EU funded programme Inoklaster LT. The results of the tests and the obtained products will be applied in the technological bases installed on the farms. Biomethane Powered Agriculture Machinery In September 2021, AUGA group developed and launched the world's first zero-emission, biomethane-electric powered hybrid tractor, AUGA M1, indented for professional use. AUGA M1 hybrid tractor is unique as it overcomes two major obstacles: refuelling and long working time, which have so far prevented major corporations around the world from offering such machines for professional use. The patented design developed by AUGA group allows equipping the tractor with larger biomethane gas cylinders. AUGA M1 tractor uses a hybrid biomethane-electric fuel system. When the tractor is running, an internal combustion engine powered by biomethane generates energy and transmits it directly to the electric motors, which turn the wheels. Under normal operating conditions that do not require much power, the tractor stores the generated energy in the batteries. Such system wastes no energy under low loads, uses a relatively small but efficient engine and is capable of generating high power when needed. These solutions enable the tractor to operate for up to 12-hours. AUGA group has solved the refuelling problem by offering quick and convenient gas cartridge replacement. In 2022, the prototype of the tractor was actively tested in real conditions and its serial production is being prepared at the Rokiškio mašinų gamykla. After the end of the reporting period, beginning of 2023, the Group presented the AUGA M1 tractor from the first production batch. Three tractors will start working on farms in the spring of the same year. Specialised Feed Technology for Cattle The Group is developing a specialised feed technology aimed at reducing methane emissions from cattle digestion processes. Since dairy farming is a significant part of the Group's closed-loop business model, and methane (CH4) contributes to the greenhouse gas effect 28 times more than CO2, the Group finds it important to take this problem into account. The concept of specialised feed technology includes innovative processes and technologies used for feed production and processing by monitoring and assessing the effect of such feed on livestock. In the reporting year, the Group continued testing the feed production technology. The use of new forages is expected to significantly reduce methane emissions per milk produced by cattle. The technological progress of the projects is at different stages of development, depending on their importance in the Group's innovation agenda, the validity of the applied technological assumptions and the market situation.

The total number of employees includes persons on childcare leave (in 2022, there were 40 such persons). As in the past, the majority of employees in 2022 were men, which is typical in the agricultural sector. Compared to previous years, the overall percentage of women has increased slightly. While men are still a majority of employees among managers, there proportion of women managers has increased. The Group does not discriminate employees based on gender in any way and provides everyone with equal work and career opportunities. The table does not include the gender distribution of the Board: 4 out of 5 members of the Board are men, i.e. 80%. In 2022, as in previous years, the largest employee group remains 30-50 years olds. There is a slight growth in the “Over 50” category. The table does not include members of the Independent Board. Their age is divided as follows: 30-50 years age group 3 members or 60%, over 50 years 2 members or 40%. As of the last day of 2022, the Group had no employees working under fixed-term employment contracts. AUGA group employees, who work under service contracts, are not included in the total number of employees. The number of part-time employees further decreased in 2022 and at the year-end it accounted for only 1.5% of all employees. Those working under service contracts made up only 0.2% of the total. It is important to note that the Group operates in the agricultural sector, where activities are seasonal. Therefore, AUGA group each year hires seasonal workers to perform weeding, picking, drying, measuring, and similar work. The Group pay such workers for their services according to payment receipts. After the end of the season, they are not included in the final number of GRI 2-7 GRI 405-1 GRI 2-8 Nasdaq V1 Nasdaq S5 Nasdaq S4 67 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> employees. During the 2022 season, the Group additionally hired 254 seasonal workers to provide the agricultural services mentioned, while in 2021 it hired 417 seasonal workers. This difference was due to the smaller areas of sugar beet grown in 2022, and therefore fewer workers needed. The Group sees a positive trend in the return of seasonal workers, which ensures more efficient work. 4.4.3. Employee Turnover and New Employees The table shows the numbers of employees who left the Group (employee turnover) and joined as new employees during the reporting year, broken down by various groups, and the percentage expression of these numbers in each of the groups. Employee turnover 2022 2021 2020 Number % Number % Number % Total: 402 32.8 368 29.8 316 24.9 By gender Women 177 33.8 152 29.6 114 21.0 Men 225 32.0 216 30.0 202 27.7 By age Under 30 years old 121 73.3 131 77.5 98 51.6 30-50 years old 172 30.5 153 26.4 126 20.8 Over 50 years old 109 21.9 84 17.4 92 19.4 By employment contracts Full-time employees 399 33.0 366 30.0 316 24.9 Part-time employees 3 16.7 2 7.0 0 0.0 Working under service contracts 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 New employees Number % Number % Number % Total: 395 32.2 331 26.8 359 28.2 By gender Women 186 35.6 122 23.7 129 23.8 Men 209 29.7 209 29.1 230 31.6 By employment contracts Under 30 years old 145 87.9 133 78.7 151 79.5 30-50 years old 157 27.8 128 22.1 150 24.8 Over 50 years old 93 18.7 70 14.5 58 12.2 In 2022, the overall employee turnover rate increased. Female turnover rose to 33.8%, from 29.6% in the previous year. This reflects an increased turnover of mushroom pickers, most of whom are women, at the company "Baltic Champs". For the same reason, the percentage of female new employees in 2022 was higher than in previous periods. The overall increase in turnover of employees corresponds to the trends in the entire Lithuanian labour market. The number of employees in the age group “under 30” is the smallest at AUGA group and accounts for 13.5% of all employees. Despite labour market trend in Lithuania of younger workers changing jobs more often, the turnover of the Group’s employees in this age group decreased by 4.2 percentage points in 2022, compared to 2021. Overall, more new hires were male in 2022, as in previous years. This is related to the fact that the Group operates in the agricultural sector, where due to the nature of the work, usually more workers are men. Note that when hiring new employees, the Group assesses candidates based on their qualifications and motivation to work and does not discriminate against them in any way on the basis of gender. GRI 401-1 GRI 2-8 Nasdaq S3 68 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> 4.4.4. Remuneration and its Distribution Remuneration Policy Employee well-being is an important objective of the Group, and one way it ensures that is through a fair and transparent remuneration policy. The policy provides for a distribution of employee pay according to their positions, specifying remuneration forms, the calculation of wages and their adjustment in the event of deviations from normal working conditions, also setting out the basis for awarding additional compensation. In implementing its remuneration policy, AUGA group uses the remuneration data analytics platform of the international company KORN FERRY. The platform allows the Group to verify the dominant remuneration trends in the market. CEO and Employees Pay Ratio In 2022, the ratio of CEO and median employee pay was 4.84 and was 9% smaller than the previous year, when it was 5.34. For several years in a row, the ratio of the pay of the CEO (the highest-paid employee) to the Group’s median salary of permanent employees has been decreasing. This change is due to the annual reviews of employee pay in line with the dominant market trends, while the CEO’s pay has remained unchanged. Note that the CEO of the Company is one of its main shareholders through Baltic Champs Group, UAB, which he controls. For more information regarding remunerations, see section 3.5. Remuneration Report. CEO's salary in 2022 remained unchanged compared to previous years. Median salaries of employees in 2022 reached EUR 1,548 and was 9% higher, compared to previous year. Gender Pay Ratio Ratio of men’s and women’s median salaries 2022 2021 2020 Workers 1.28 1.22 1.19 Management 1.33 1.31 1.84 Specialists 1.16 1.18 1.26 Total: 1.22 1.22 1.28 The work of each employee is evaluated according to the results achieved in his or her field, and the Group does not tolerate different remuneration for the same type of work. In 2022, the median pay ratio for AUGA group employees of different genders remained the same as in 2021 and reached 1.22, while in 2020 the figure was 1.28. The higher salaries of men at AUGA group are due to the positions they hold and their competences. AUGA group conducts all its activities in one region, Lithuania, therefore the data are not distinguished by country and geographical regions. Additional Incentives for Employees One way the Group seeks to continuously motivate its employees is through a share option programme. AUGA group has offered this incentive for four years. In 2022, 238 employees participated in the programme, of whom 26 were new participants. Further information regarding the share option programme is presented in section 3.6.3. Share Option Programme. Additional financial incentives are provided to AUGA group's employees for significant performance achievements. In 2022, additional financial incentives were given to 62 employees. The Group's employees are also encouraged through symbolic appreciation bonuses at the end of the year. In 2022, a total of 1,175 employees received such bonuses. The Group does not provide financial incentives to employees or members of management or supervisory bodies for the formation, development, and implementation of a long-term sustainability strategy. Employees responsible for this area are financially encouraged in the same way as other employees of the Group. Collective Agreements In 2022 AUGA group did not conclude any collective agreements with employees (0%). Employees are not prohibited from taking the initiative to create employee associations defined in the Labour Code or implementing other social partnerships, as far as the relations between the employer and employees are concerned or conducting collective negotiations. The Group, in accordance with Human Rights, Non-Discrimination, Children and Forced Labour Policy, does not support disciplinary or discriminatory actions GRI 405-2 GRI 2-30 GRI 2-20 GRI 2-21 GRI 2-19 Nasdaq S1 Nasdaq S2 Nasdaq V3 Nasdaq V4 69 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022 CONTENTS> against employees, who choose to join associations peacefully and lawfully. According to the guidelines set out in the policy, employees of the Group are prohibited from using any form of intimidation to prevent other employees from exercising their right to join or not to join any association. 4.4.5. Health and Safety Occupational Health and Safety Policy AUGA group considers it extremely important for the Group to ensure a safe working environment for its employees. Employee safety is seen as one of the top priorities in all operations of AUGA group. Under its Occupational Health and Safety Policy, the Group continuously strives to improve the working environment for its employees, the rules for safety at work and their implementation mechanisms. The Occupational Health and Safety Policy is published on the AUGA group website. Additionally, at least once a year, the Group conducts periodic work safety and health audits. The process is overseen by qualified external consultants from two companies that specialise in work safety matters. They are thus responsible for training employees, preparing, revising and improving job instructions, investigating accidents at work and preparing their prevention plans, and making suggestions for improving general work safety. Companies of the Group are periodically inspected by the State Labour Inspectorate. During the reporting year, no fines were received for work safety violations and no significant non-compliances were recorded. The Group does not have a unified occupational safety and health system that meets ISO standards. Specialised requirements apply for specific areas of activity. Every new employee of the Group must familiarise themself with the rules and update this knowledge regularly. AUGA group expects that all its business partners to adhere to these occupational safety and health principles as well and therefore reminds them about that every year. Accidents at Work AUGA group operates in the agricultural sector where manual work is common. Each employee working in the Group is provided with safety and health instructions specifically suited to their duties, which detail the main possible risks in the workplace and explain how to avoid them. All employees, when they start working for the Group, are required to familiarise themselves with these instructions and periodically updated that knowledge. In 2022, the Group registered 14 accidents, in which workers suffered minor injuries, such as: minimal bodily injury from a fall or rupture of a finger tendon. The workers involved recovered quickly, and none of them suffered long-term disability resulting from the injury. No workplace accidents were observed in 2022 among seasonal workers, who work on the basis of payment receipts. As in previous years, no deaths were recorded at the workplace during the year. The Group’s companies aim to reduce the risk of potential injuries at work, with the goal of reducing this risk to 0. For this reason, safety procedures are regularly reviewed, employees receive training on safe working processes, risks are discussed, and attention is paid to the introducing safety measures to prevent accidents at work. In 2022, there were 0.0114 accidents per employee (or 0.00066% of all working hours, i.e. 2,129,237 hours). In 2021, the figure was 0.0105 per employee (or 0.0006% of all working hours). In 2022, the accident rate per million hours worked was 6.58. Seasonal workers are not included in this number. Health and Safety Training of Employees In 2022, AUGA group carried out health and safety training for employees in their production units on the following topics: general health and safety training; loading of goods with a forklift, electric forklift and manually; working with animals; and metal processing equipment. Supplementary Health Insurance AUGA group cares about the health of its employees and provides supplementary health insurance for all workers employed under a permanent contract for more than three months. Seasonal workers do not receive additional health insurance. Supplementary health insurance allows employees to receive services at all healthcare institutions, enables early healthcare of the insured, ensures help when the unexpected happens, and saves time for getting to healthcare. This health insurance makes it quicker and more convenient to access health-related services, such as medical treatment at selected health care institutions, consultations with family and other physicians, various tests, medicines, and other healthenhancing services, including therapeutic massages and physiotherapy sessions. With this insurance, AUGA group workers can enhance not only their physical, but, also, emotional health – employees are given the conditions to visit psychologists. In addition, workers can use their supplementary health insurance to reimburse the costs of COVID-19 tests, when required by a medical institution. Happily, the Group's data shows that AUGA group’s employees are using the possibility for medical examinations and are enhancing their health more often.

The rate of employee participation in the study reached 87%. The majority of employees who participated in the study, i.e., 58% would recommend AUGA group to their friends, family or business partners. On a scale of -100% to 100%, the overall eNPS score was 45%. According to global trends, AUGA group's overall employee satisfaction rate is rated as very good.

The Group donated money to the non-governmental organization "Blue/Yellow", which supports Ukrainian soldiers by non-lethal means, and to the National Cancer Institute, which, since the beginning of the war, has been treating patients, who arrived from Ukraine to Lithuania. AUGA group has also given humanitarian aid by providing organic food products produced by AUGA together with purchased diapers. The total value of all support in 2022 was nearly EUR 60,000. 4 The eNPS indicator is calculated as follows: survey participants are asked the question "How likely would you recommend AUGA group as an employer to your acquaintances?”, then they are divided into three groups "Recommenders", "Passives" and "Disappointed". Recommenders are those who chose ratings 9-10, Passives 7-8, Disappointed 0-6. NPS is obtained by counting the percentage of Recommenders and subtracting the percentage of Disappointed, dividing it by all those who participated in the survey. The resulting percentage number describes the company's NPS, which can range from -100 to 100.
