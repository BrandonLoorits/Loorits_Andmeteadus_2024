All previously identified T

the technical screening criteria and substantially 
contribute to one of the six environmental 
objectives. T

substantial contribution criteria, the exis

these principles in all companies of the Group. 
It aims to create a business culture and practice

development
. Among other things, the Sustainability 
Policy discloses the Group
’s commitments to follow 
the UNGC principles, coordinate its stra

and activities with the SDGs, participate in the Paris 
Agreement and fight climate change while adopting 
good governance practices.
Information on our other policies and sus
tainability 
management is av
ailable publicly and in this report. 
T
oge

sustainability management
, we periodically publish 
sustainability highlights and ESG data in our interim 
and annual reports. This is to make sure tha

Materiality assessment 
The Group recognises the importance of aligning 
its business operations with the e
xpectations of its 
stak
eholders and the broader environmental and 
social landscape. Using the concept o
f materiality
, 
we can identify
, prioritise and then manage the k
ey 
topics of sustainability
.
Following the new sustainability reporting 
requirements, the Group is currently conducting a 
double materiality assessment
. This approach aims 
to see both the extent to which sus
tainability topics 
impact the company and the company’s impact 
on these topics. The results of the Group’s double 
materiality assessment will be published in our 
website and in the Sustainability report for 
the year 2024. 
In this report
, we are disclosing sustainability-related 
information based on our comprehensive impact 
materiality assessment
, which was conducted in 
2021. It identifies and prioritises the k
ey sustainability 
topics that are most relev
ant and material to the 
Group’s business and its stak
eholders. The benefits 
of performing this assessment when shaping 
sustainability priorities include the following:
 
–
 
the greatest positive impact
.
 W
e aim to 
concentrate our sustainability actions in areas 
where we can have the mos
t significant positive 
impact;  
 
–
 
mutual value for the Group and its external 
environment
. 
The value created by sus
tainability 
must benefit both the Group and the persons or 
the organisations that can be impacted by the 
Group’s decisions and, in turn, whose decisions 
may impact the Group; 
 
–
 
bolstering stak
eholder ties.
 Involving 
stak
eholders in developing sustainability actions 
helps strengthen mutually valuable ties.

Our approach to conducting a materiality 
assessment  
The Group identified four stages of the ma
teriality 
assessment process, including identifying significant 
topics, mapping out stak
eholders for whom these 
topics may be significant
, prioritising topics and 
forming stra
tegic goals accordingly
. More details on 
each stage are provided below
.
Step 1. Identifying relevant sustainability topics (see 
table in page 168)
Based on the information obtained from v
arious 
sources, including employee f
ocus groups, 
customer surveys, inv
estor questionnaires, media 
monitoring, and various other document analy
ses, 19 
sustainability topics that may be o
f relevance to the 
Group have been identified. 
Step 2. Mapping sustainability topics to different 
stak
eholders (see table on the right)
Stak
eholder involvement is crucial to ensure that the 
Group's activities are carried out responsibly and 
coherently
. By including social and en
vironmental 
issues in our relations with stak
eholders, we aim 
not only to contribute to building a sustainable 
society and preserving the environment for future 
generations, but also to encourage o
thers to 
contribute. In carrying out our activities, we strive 
to consider the interests of our stak
eholders and 
to mak
e decisions that meet their best interests. 
The Group identifies the k
ey stak
eholders and the 
expectations o
f each stak
eholder group on our 
sustainability matters.
The materiality assessment process involved 
engaging with a wide range of stak
eholders. W
e 
received almost 3,000 responses from stak
eholders, 
including employees, priv
ate and business 
customers, inves
tors, shareholders, suppliers, 
contractors, communities and others.
Through in-depth interviews, surveys and workshops, 
the Group gathered valuable insights into the 
sustainability issues that are the most important 
to the Group and its stak
eholders. The Group 
performed the impact assessment and assessed 
the expectations o
f stak
eholders in respect to 19 
diff
erent sustainability topics impor
tant to the Group 
and its major subsidiaries.
Further information on stak
eholder engagement is 
av
ailable on our website.
Step 3. Prioritising material sustainability topics (see 
table in page 170)
Considering stak
eholders' expectations is an 
important par
t of shaping sustainability priorities. 
During strategic sessions, the Group
's management 
discussed how the expressed views can be bes
t 
embedded into and served by the Group's str
ategy
. 
The Group’s materiality matrix illus
trates the outcome 
of these discussions, i.e
., the sustainability topics 
that are important to the Group, and shows how 
each topic reflects stak
eholder opinions and our 
strategic priorities. Its v
ertical axis reflects the views 
of stak
eholders on the significance of diff
erent 
sustainability topics to the Group. The horiz
ontal axis 
presents the sustainability topics in terms of their 
relative impact and importance to the Group’s k
ey 
strategic objectiv
es. 
The matrix highlights the most relev
ant topics of 
a roadmap for reducing our impact on the natural 
and social environment while creating v
alue for 
our stak
eholders and the Group as a whole. W
e

sustainability goals and their implementation 
programmes in priority areas. 
ESG risks are included in the general risk 
assessment process
At the time the materiality assessment was 
conducted, it was guided by the impact materiality 
approach, meaning that we considered the impact 
we as a business have on the en
vironment and 
society
. The concep
t of double materiality requires 
the Group to identify how sustainability topics may 
aff
ect the organisation. As stak
eholders expect to be 
able to see the risks that an organisation faces and 
how it manages them, a responsible risk assessment 
and transparent disclosure are essential to maintain 
stak
eholder trust
.  
The risk assessment process for these topics has 
been conducted by the Group, and the ESG factors 
are now being fully considered when assessing any 
risk of the Group. All ESG risk
s are included in the 
integral risk management process, including climate 
change, hea
lth and safety
, employ
ee-related risks, etc. 
For further details on the Group’s risk
s, including risks, 
see section ‘4.7 Risk management’ of this report
. 
Step 4. Setting stra
tegic goals (see table in page
 
171)
The Group’s str
ategy and sustainability initiatives 
are aligned with the evalua
ted material sustainability 
topics identified during materiality assessment
, 
meaning that the Group demonstra
tes its 
commitment to operating in a responsible and 
sustainable manner
. The Group will continue to 
engage to stak
eholders and monitor the materiality 
landscape to ensure that its sustainability eff
orts 
remain relevant and impactful.

ailable on our website.

t times. 
The Group is exploring the dev
elopment of P2X technologies, which convert 
ex
cess renewable energy into valuable products such as h
ydrogen and 
synthetic fuels. W
e pursue the development of a pilot project
, leading to the full 
commercialization of P2X technologies in the longer term.
The Group has integrated pumped-stor
age hydro into the ener
gy system 
and is looking to integrate batteries as well, which suppor
t the integration of 
renewables by facilitating the demand management
, helping improve the grid 
reliability and limiting the output curtailment.

Group's reliance on fossil fuels and its GHG 
emissions;
 
–
 
utilising the integrated business model: 
the 
Group's integra
ted business model, encompassing 
power generation, distribution and re
tail, plays a 
crucial role in enabling the transition to a green 
energy sys
tem. The Group leverages its e
xper
tise 
in each segment to optimise the flow of energy 
and ensure a smooth transition;
 
–
 
maximising sustainable value:
 the Group is 
committed to ma
ximising sustainable value 
by directing its stra
tegic focus towards 
decarbonisation, OHS, employee e
xperience, 
diversity and creating sustainable products and 
services. The Group strives to create a positive 
impact on the society and the environment while 
delivering value to its shareholders.
Measures to reduce GHG emissions 
As mentioned earlier in the report
, the Group is 
committed to nearly halv
e its GHG emissions by 
2030. T
o implement its tr
ansition, the Group has 
prepared an internal package of mitigation measures 
based on diff
erent scopes to be implemented within 
the Group and its companies. The measures are 
categorised based on their potential implementation 
period – short-term, medium-term and long-term.  
Each company of the Group is updating its measures 
and following its progress and efficienc
y every 
year
. On the other hand, the decisions regarding 
the implementation of a specific measure are made 
during the strategic planning or b
y separate decisions 
of persons and/
or collegial bodies authorised to 
mak
e such decisions when it is necess
ary and 
when the complete information essential to mak
e 
a decision, including the implementation costs, the 
estimated eff
ect
, etc., is made av
ailable. It must be 
noted that some of the measures are considered 
preliminary and may be implemented to enhance 
operational efficienc
y
, ensure reliabilit
y and, thereby
, 
positively impact the emission reduction goals. New 
measures may also be added ev
ery year
.

OSSES IN THE
 ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
One of the main factors aff
ecting GHG emission levels in Networks 
is energy losses that occur during electricity distribution activities. 
They can be categorised into two types: direct losses (in transformer 
stations, power lines, substa
tions and other network elements) and 
indirect losses (for ex
ample, when there
's ice on power lines or 
consumers declare their electricity consumption data incorrectly).
The total length of our electricity grid is 127,500 km. W
e actively monitor and strategically 
address the technological losses in the electricity distribution network since it’s one of the 
main objectives of the Networks segment
. Our loss reduction measures include:
 
–
 
utilising smar
t metering systems with modern, ener
gy-efficient meters f
or precise loss 
monitoring and identification;
 
–
 
analysing the 0.4–10 kV network to pinpoint the components causing significant losses and 
to minimise the unaccounted electricity consumption;
 
–
 
upgrading transformer stations to more modern, ener
gy-efficient models and conducting 
regular metrological inspections;
 
–
 
replacing outdated 6–10 kV transformer stations with newer
, more efficient v
ersions;
 
–
 
modernising the heating and lighting in transformer substations and dis
tribution points (TP
/
DP) by switching to fluorescent lights or LEDs and updating heating s
ystems with automated 
solutions;
 
–
 
promoting the T
rust Line to residents to confidentially report suspected energy theft, aiding 
further loss reduction.
 
–
 
The total volume of electricity distributed in 2023 was 10.14 
TWh (10.5 TWh in 2022). The technological losses of distributed 
electricity were 4.05% (5% in 2022). 
 
–
 
GHG emissions from the losses amounted to 82 thous
and t CO
2
-eq, 
i.e
., 20% of the Group’s to
tal Scope 2 emissions.
 
–
 
ESO (Networks) aims to reduce the total electricity distribution 
technological losses as much as possible and in 2024 undertakes to 
limit them to 5.11% under all circumstances.

T
echnological losses in the gas distribution ne
twork include 
technological and commercial losses (e.g., theft). This section co
vers 
only the volume of gas used for technological purposes, which is 
related to the release of gas into the atmosphere
.
The composition of natural gas is about 90% me
thane, which is a 
greenhouse gas. Therefore
, any natural gas spill from the dis
tribution 
network into the atmosphere directly relates to methane emissions.
The total length of our gas distribution ne
twork is 9,600 km. W
e have implemented se
veral 
measures to reduce the natural gas spills into the atmosphere:
 
–
 
our methodology for calculating technological losses has been revised. W
e assessed the 
dependency of coefficients used to calcula
te equipment losses on the natural gas network 
operations, natur
al gas spills measurements and reconstruction works. This assessment 
incorporated factual results from pilot projects;
 
–
 
we regularly inspect operational gas pipelines for leaks using specialized na
tural gas leak 
detectors. Steel pipelines undergo annual inspections, while poly
ethylene pipelines are 
inspected every five years. Leaks detected in the dis
tribution network are immediately 
addressed;
 
–
 
we employ the PLEXOR s
ystem for inspecting equipment tha
t regulates natural gas pressure 
in pipelines;
 
–
 
during the connection of new distribution pipelines, maintenance (reconstruction) or repairs 
on existing pipelines, we use a technology tha
t allows us to connect or switch pipelines 
without reducing the natural gas pressure
, thereby minimizing methane emissions;
 
–
 
approximately 99% of our underground steel dis
tribution pipelines are safeguarded against 
active corrosion. W
e inspect and repair the protective lay
er of these pipelines every six 
years. Additionally
, we restore the protective la
yer on steel dis
tribution pipelines and inlets 
above the surface to minimize corrosion and reduce the lik
elihood of natural gas leaks.
 
–
 
The total volume of gas distributed in 2023 was 6.44 TWh (6.81 TWh 
in 2022). The technological losses related to the release of gas into 
the atmosphere were 0.61% (1.22% in 2022). 
 
–
 
GHG emissions resulting from the losses were 71.2 thous
and  
t CO
2
-eq, i.e
., 16% of the Group’s to
tal Scope 1 emissions. 
 
–
 
We aim to reduce the total na
tural gas distribution technological 
losses as much as possible and undertake to limit them to 2.2% 
under all circumstances.

Units in Elektrėnai Complex are gas fired. W
e are looking for measures 
to reduce GHG emissions from generation.
In 2023, for the first time, Elektrėnai Comple
x purchased and used biogas (50 MWh). The 
intention was to test the opera
tion of generation units with this type of gas.
Biogas can help in reducing Scope 1 GHG emissions. 50 MWh of 
biogas saves about 9 t CO

Educating our customers and providing a possibility to choose green 
energy or alternative solutions to mitiga
te GHG emissions.
T
o encourage cus
tomers to choose green energy and other solutions to mitigate GHG 
emissions, we consult them on energy efficienc
y and emissions reduction issues, off
er energy 
efficienc
y consultancy
, remote solar park, wind farm and other services. W
e are constantly 
improving our services to make them more a
ttractive and con
venient to customers.
W
e continued the practice of consulting business customers on their emissions, shared 
information on how to prepare their energy management plan. In response to the v
olatility of 
energy prices, we decided to encourage our customers to use ener
gy more efficiently
.
W
e helped our customer to acquire a carbon offse
t cer
tificate to compensate GHG emissions 
from its natural gas consumption in 2023, howe
ver
, we do not plan to continue providing this 
service.
1.7% of independent electricity supply (private) customers chose to 
consume green energy (7.5% in 2022). Green energy supply has also 
been chosen by 25.1% of business customers (64.8% in 2022). The 
share of green energy in total independent electricity supply activities 
amounted to 17.4% (2.3% in 2022). 
Decreasing green energy volumes correlate with lar
ge energy price 
fluctuations, which forced both priv
ate and business customers to 
first look for solutions on how to reduce the price, and only then think 
about the origin of energy
.

Encouraging employ
ees of all levels to choose en
vironmentally 
friendly means of transport
.
The Group companies whose combined vehicle fleets comprise 92% of the entire flee
t 
undertake to reduce GHG emissions from polluting fuel consumption b
y 42% until 2030 (vs 
2020). In addition, we have a tar
get to use electric common-purpose vehicles in at leas
t 50% of 
business trav
els. Some of the measures tak
en in 2023 include the following:
 
–
 
in response to an employee survey that highlighted the concerns related to the electric 
vehicle (EV) range and usage, we conducted tr
aining on the proper and safe use of EV
s and 
charging stations;
 
–
 
we’ve updated our vehicle fleet management app to prioritise EV
s for employ
ee bookings 
up to 150 km. If no EV
s are available, the app will reserve the least polluting car;
 
–
 
regular eco-driving and s
afe driving pr
actical courses are conducted within the Group. 
 
–
 
ESO (Networks) has created a tool to monitor transport emissions and eco-driving, 
generating monthly reports on team vehicle performance, fuel consumption, and emissions. 
These reports are reviewed for coordinated improvement actions;
 
–
 
aligning with our fleet management policy
, we hav
e initiated a Mobility program for 
managers. This program aims to phase out all company vehicles with internal combus
tion 
engines by 2030. Participants can opt for a personal electric or other low-emission vehicle
, 
partially funded by the Group, or utilize services lik
e carsharing, carpool, or ta
xi, with a 
monthly budget provided by the Group
. Additionally
, electric cars have been purchased 
and assigned to k
ey executives;
 
–
 
Group employees can earn points in the Recognition program b
y participating in a 
sustainable tra
vel initiative f
or commuting. This incentive aims to encourage walking, c
ycling, 
or scootering to and from work, promoting phy
sical activity and reducing CO
2
 emissions;
 
–
 
we continued projects related to increasing the energy efficienc
y of offices and reno
vated 
12 premises of Group companies.
 
–
 
In 2023, 103 Group employees attended pr
actical eco-driving 
courses, which focus on building driving skills. W
e estimate that by 
applying eco-driving principles in practice, carbon emissions could 
be reduced by 5%.
 
–
 
49% of the common-purpose vehicles in the Group that can be 
used by Group employ
ees for work (ex
cluding the Networks 
segment and other special-purpose vehicles) are EV

Actions to promote sustainable solutions and e
fficient use o
f energy in 2023
Smart meters roll-out
 
A mass roll-out of smart meters (Networks) was started in July 2022. In 2023, around 519,000 smar
t meters were installed (the initial targe
t of the year w
as ex
ceeded by almost 
19,000 units). The first phase of the smart meter roll-out is installing around 1.2 million smart meters for customers with the highest electricity consumption by 2026. A
t a later phase, 
customers consuming less than 1,000 kWh of electricity per year will ha
ve their meters replaced upon the expiry of their metrological verification period. Residents with smart 
meters will no longer hav
e to write down meter readings by hand and will be able to access and see their e
xact electricity consumption online, receiv
e new services from market 
participants and use energy more efficiently
.
A representative survey conducted in November 2023 re
vealed that after installing a smart meter
, 1 in 2 customers changed their energy consumption habits at least partially by 
starting to monitor energy consumption data more closely
.
Expanding the Ignitis ON EV charging network 
W
e continue to expand the Ignitis ON EV charging network. Currently
, 376 public charging points are a
vailable in total, 364 of which are in Lithuania (link in Lithuanian). 
In 2023, the first 12 public Ignitis ON charging points started operating in Latvia. W
e intend to expand and become the leading charging opera
tor in Latvia. The electricity supplied 
to the Ignitis ON network is produced from renewable energy sources.  
Remote solar park
s and wind farm to rent
 
In 2023, a total of 7.6 MW of remote solar parks were sold to cus
tomers of which around 1.7 thousand B2C customers and more than 40 B2B customers through www
.eparkai.lt 
platform.  
Ignitis (Customers & Solutions) was the first company in the world tha
t off
ered to rent a wind farm to consumers. By the end of 2023, more than 150 customers used this service.
Connecting prosumers to the grid
 
The number of new prosumers connected to the distribution network in 2023 was around 29.6 thousand (18.7 thousand in 2022), driven by improved technologies, increased 
awareness, growing sta
te support and recent spikes in electricity prices.  
Energy efficienc
y for the public and customers
 
 
–
 
While implementing the agreements in accordance with Ar
ticle 7 of the Republic o
f Lithuania Law on Increasing Energy Efficienc
y (related to energy savings), the 
estimated cumulativ
e eff
ect of implemented energy saving measures by 2030 reached almos
t 133.3 GWh (targe
t – 107.5 GWh). The results ma
y change after the e
xpected 
methodological changes suggested by the Group will be implemented. 
 
–
 
While implementing the agreements in accordance with Ar
ticle 8 of the Republic o
f Lithuania Law on Increasing Energy Efficienc
y (related to consumer education and 
consultation), we submitted reports to the Minis
try of Energy and the Lithuanian Energy Agency on the implementation of consumer educa
tion and consultation measures in 
2023. The submitted ener
gy savings after the implementa
tion of consumer education are almost 108.7 G
Wh (target – 100.7 GWh). 
 
–
 
We continued our eff
orts to improve the digital tools for customers f
or monitoring their energy consumption. Ignitis (Customers & Solutions) implemented compar
ative energy 
analysis solutions in all its channels: self-service platforms, bills and the mobile app, allowing bo
th private and business customers o
f natural gas and electricity to compare their 
energy consumption with previous y
ears as well as with similar consumer groups. The system also provides tips on energy efficienc
y
. 
 
–
 
Ignitis (Customers & Solutions) is off
ering consultations on GHG emissions assessment to companies. Companies are invited to enter their electricity
, gas, vehicle as well as air 
trav
el data. During the consultations, we identify energy efficienc
y measures and renewable energy sources that would help reduce the emissions.  
 
–
 
We are continuously enhancing the Ignitis EnergySmart application, enabling customers to monitor their electricity usage and receive efficienc
y tips. The app displays the 
daily consumption’s highs and lows, detects unusual spik
es and shows a 30-day a
verage to help evaluate usage patterns, allowing f
or stable bills. As the smart meter installation 
continues, more customers can access the expanded f
eatures of the app
. The latest update allow
s EV owners to charge their vehicles based on energy mark
et prices, thus 
optimising charging costs and ener
gy use.

High physical impact (4°C warming) or no mitiga
tion scenario: Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathwa
y (SSP) 5-8.5 of the 6
th
 Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC). 
This scenario represents the most 'unprecedented' or 'worst-case
' scenario from a 
physical climate change perspectiv
e, assuming a future with limited mitigation measures, 
ongoing emissions growth at current rates and a global a
verage tempera
ture increase 
of 4ºC by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels.
Future risks include:
 
–
 
rising temperatures;
 
–
 
changing rainfall patterns;
 
–
 
increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather
.
Scope – the assessment covered almost 300 sites, including:
 
–

T
ransitional risks and 
opportunities
Rapid transition (<1.5°C warming) or high-mitigation scenario: Ne
t Zero (NZE) scenario 
of the International Energy Agenc
y (IEA) was used where av
ailable; for some risks and 
opportunities the analysis also drew on other net zero-aligned sources to complement 
the findings where additional data was needed.
This scenario presents a pathwa
y to eff
ective climate mitigation which sees 
global energy sector CO
2
 emissions reach net zero b
y 2050, while also taking into 
consideration other sus
tainable development goals, such as universal access to energy 
and air quality improvements. Future risks and opportunities include:
 
–
 
more stringent climate policies and carbon pricing;
 
–
 
technology innovation to support the low carbon transition;
 
–
 
changing consumer market demands.
Scope –  the assessment was done across all four business segments of the Group: 
Green Generation, Networks, R
eser
ve Capacities, and Customers & Solutions.
During the assessment
, all scopes of the Group’s emissions were also considered.

intense and frequent in all the countries the Group is operating in. This 
could aff
ect the efficienc
y of solar panels, EV sites and the grid. However

a moderate risk for the Group
’s wind energy production, depending on 
whether turbines need to be shut down during especially intense storms. 
Windstorms could also damage the grid.

reinforced the validity of the Group
’s strategic 
objectives, including the expansion o
f Green 
Generation and sustainable solutions f
or customers. 
The assessment of the climate-related risk
s drew 
upon our existing risk regis
ter while including all the 
risks that were not identified pre
viously
. The climate-
related risks are already fully integra
ted into our 
risk management framework. Following a thorough 
internal examina
tion of the CSA findings in 2024, 
the risk register will be updated to incorpora
te new 
climate-related risks tha
t will serve as focal points for 
future assessments. The Group is committed to work 
continuously while strengthening its understanding of 
climate-related risks to financially qualify their actual 
and potential impacts, arising opportunities and the 
strategies required f
or mitigation and adaptation o
f

Storage technologies, such as commercial-scale batteries and 
green hydrogen, are essential to enable the low-carbon tr
ansition. 
In a 1.5°C scenario this would represent a high-to-very-high 
opportunity for the Group as it would enable the storage and 
commercialisation of surplus green energy
, increasing revenues.

EU
 
Carbon prices are expected to increase by ~1.7x by 2030 
and 3x by 2050 under the 1.5°C scenario. This could lead to 
the Group facing a risk of increasing costs for ener
gy and heat 
generation. Howev

is predominantly green and still expanding, thus this represents 
an opportunity through the Group’s comparative advantages in 
renewable electricity production.

EU
 
Under the 1.5°C scenario, the demand for k
ey materials, such 
as aluminium, copper
, silicon and steel, is e
xpected to increase 
significantly in the medium and long term, thus increasing the 
procurement costs and potentially creating shortages. This would 
represent a considerable risk for the Group

vironmental protection principles related to pollution, 
including: 
 
–
 
regular monitoring of the environmental impact of activities, facilities, products and 
services; 
 
–
 
application of the highest international standards and the best a
vailable technologies and 
generation methods in oper
ations;
 
–
 
application of impact reduction measures, responsible maintenance of facilities and their 
modernisation; 
 
–
 
monitoring, control and transparent communication;
 
–
 
implementation and continuous improvement of environmental management sy
stems 
based on the ISO 14001 standard, etc.
In terms of pollution prevention, the Group En
vironmental Policy aims to pre
vent pollution 
by following legal and environmental requirements, reducing the lik
elihood of accidents 
and environmental impact and solving environmental issues by applying the bes
t available 
technologies and practices. The policy also inv
olves regularly analysing the impact of the 
Group’s activities on the environment
, assessing risks and implementing measures to reduce 
negative impacts.
Group 
Sustainability 
Policy
 
The policy defines the following principles related to pollution:
 
–
 
the Group under
tak
es preventive measures to ensure en
vironmental protection;
 
–
 
 
the Group undertakes initiativ
es to increase environmental responsibility where it can 
ex
ercise influence;
 
–
 
the Group promotes the development and dissemination of environmentally friendly 
technologies.
ISO 14001 
standard
In order to ensure compliance with legal acts and minimise the lik
elihood of environmental 
pollution, the Group companies (ESO (Networks), Ignitis Gamyba (R
eserve Capacities and 
Green Generation), Vilnius CHP and Kaunas CHP (both Green Gener
ation), Ignitis (Customers 
& Solutions) have implemented the ISO 14001 s
tandard, so their activities comply with the 
requirements of the most important environmental monitoring, management and improve-
ment aspects.

tunities
 
Actions
Soil pollution:
 
–
 
soil contamination can occur 
because of maintenance or 
operation activities in solar 
parks and wind farms, energy 
distribution activities, potentially 
due to the release of pollutants 
into the environment;
 
–
 
materials produced during 
the combustion processes 
in power plants have the 
potential to contaminate various 
environmental components, 
including soil.
T
ransitional risks:
 
–
 
political/legal: increasingly 
stringent regulation;
 
–
 
financial: investments in new 
technologies to meet stricter 
requirements, reduce the

(ex
ceeding emission limits, 
pollution incidents due to 
equipment failure or leakage).
 
–

for generation or 
other purposes) 
W
ater use 
(groundwater and 
surface water used 
for technological 
process) 
Physical risk:
 
–
 
not enough water to generate electricity;
 
–
 
reduced generation due to hydrological droughts;
 
–
 
operational disruptions caused by floods;
 
–
 
insufficient amount of w
ater for cooling needs.
T
ransitional risks:
 
–
 
political / legal: increasingly stringent regulation;
 
–
 
financial: investments in new technologies to meet 
stricter requirements, reduce the probability of pollution 
incidents and justify the expectations o
f stak
eholders;
 
–
 
reputational: public pressure to act in more 
environmentally friendly wa
ys.
 
–
 
Using new technologies for better control and more 
eff
ective monitoring.
 
–
 
Replacing the substances and compounds used in 
activities with environmentally friendly alternatives.
 
–
 
Good reputation among stak
eholders when our activities 
are balanced with the needs of the nature
.
Kaunas HP
, Kruonis PSHP (both Green Generation): 
 
–
 
we ensure that water level fluctuation in the Kaunas Lagoon mee
ts the environmental 
requirements. The water lev
el measures are updated every hour on the website (link in 
Lithuanian) of Ignitis Gamyba (R
eserve Capacities and Green Generation); 
 
–
 
we are increasing the efficienc
y of water use (for e
xample, during the renova
tion, 
Kaunas HPP's (Green Generation) turbines were changed to more efficient ones tha
t 
use 94% of the flowing water f
or generation (previously – 91%)) and reducing the 
impact on ecosystems (research show
s that the risks to fish are minimal);  
 
–
 
Kaunas HPP (Green Generation) facilities use special biodegradable, low-ecoto
xicit
y oil; 
 
–
 
the Group monitors indicators of both water use (wa
ter withdrawal, w
ater reuse, 
water release and consumption) and intensity (intensity of wa
ter use in the operation 
of hy
dropower facilities, intensity of water use in genera
tion and overall w
ater use 
efficienc
y).  
Elektrėnai Complex (R
eserve Capacities): 
 
–
 
to ensure that the water quality has not been degraded in the Group’s facilities, we 
are measuring the quality of the water used for cooling the equipment in Elektrėnai 
Complex (R
eserve Capacities), which is released back to the environment after the 
cooling process;
 
–
 
the IPPC permit for Elektrėnai Complex (Reserve Capacities) obliges us to ensure

, follow the principle of non-disturbance o
f protected areas and the 
integrity of species and habitats of high ecological value
, avoid deforesta
tion and conversion 
of territories of high ecological value
, develop biodiversity protection projects, restore 
the territory where the operations were carried out
, follow the principle of free, prior
, and 
informed consent (FPIC) and follow the principle of no

Wind farms (Green Generation): 
 
–
 
Ignitis Renewables (Green Generation) collabora
tes with ornithologists and 
conducts bird monitoring to assess whether wind turbines hav
e a significant 
impact on bird populations. If a significant impact is identified, we implement 
additional mitigation measures (stopping the wind turbines or reducing the number 
of operating wind turbines on the main da
ys of bird migration, installing flashing 
warning lights to scare awa
y the birds at night) and carr
y out additional monitoring 
for one year to monitor whe
ther the impact mitigation measures are eff
ective 
(Mažeikiai WF in Lithuania, Pomerania WF in P
oland, Silesia WF II in Poland); 
 
–
 
monitoring bats, coordinating the activities of the wind farm with the life cy
cle of 
bats (limiting light
, avoiding white light
, etc.) (Mažeikiai WF in Lithuania, Pomer
ania 
WF in Poland, Silesia WF II in P
oland);
 
–
 
during the construction phase, we tak
e measures to protect flora and fauna: move 
protected species to suitable habitats, mark the species or habitats tha
t cannot be 
moved accordingly
, etc.;
 
–
 
the removal of trees and bushes from 1 March 2023 to 30 September 2023 is 
carried out only after consulta
tion with ornithologists (considering the nesting birds 
in the vicinity of the wind farm) (Pomerania WF in P
oland, Silesia WF II in Poland);
 
–
 
to reduce the visual impact, wind turbines are painted with light shades o
f matte 
paint (Mali and T

we use neutral colours to reduce the visual impact;
 
–
 
we leave passages in a fence for animals so as not to disrupt their migr

Reducing the impact on the

Electricity distribution network (Networks):
 
–
 
we are investing in increasing the resilience of the network to the eff
ects of climate 
change (overhead power lines are being replaced with underground ones in 
the most vulnerable places). This helps to adapt to e
xtreme weather conditions 
caused by climate change while reducing the impact on the landscape
, avoiding 
the fragmentation or loss of habita
ts and reducing the number of trees that need to 
be removed; 
 
–
 
we are revising the tree removal procedures in forested areas to reduce the 
number of trees removed in the pro
tection zones (the strip o
f land along the 
overhead power line where the service and maintenance of the power line tak
es 
place) and to remove only those that pose the grea
test threat;
 
–
 
we are developing a mechanism for compensating the negative impact on the 
environment caused during the network maintenance;
 
–
 
in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency and based on the Act o
f 
Protected Species of Animals, Plants and Fungi, we remov
e and restore or relocate 
stork nests that pose a threa

responding to unscheduled emergency power line outages. W
e endeavour to 
carry out these works during non-transition periods (e.g., in winter). ESO (Networks)

Actions
The Group has already started the transition to a 
circular economy and efficient use o
f resources. 
Currently the Group is developing more detailed 
action plans on how it will transition awa
y from 
the use of virgin resources and how to increase 
the use of secondary resources thus enhancing 
the circularity in its own operations and along the 
upstream and downstream v
alue chain.

Policies and other documents f
orming the resource use and circular economy management at the Group 
Document / standard
 
Description
Group Environmental Polic
y
 
The policy promotes the ra
tional and conservative management of resources, such as energy
, fuel, commodities, waste, b
y-products, etc., the reduction of was
te from operations and ensures safe and 
responsible management of resources by applying pollution prev
ention principles. The policy also promotes moving tow
ards the global transition to a circular economy by applying its principles in the 
Group’s activities, ensuring that resource e
fficienc
y is considered during the designing phase and environmental impacts are reduced based on the lifecycle assessment
.
Group Sustainability Policy
The policy includes a commitment to increase the Group’s en
vironmental responsibility where it can exercise influence and promo
tes the development and dissemination o
f environmentally friendly 
technologies. 
Supplier Code of Ethics
The SCE includes all the mandatory environmental requirements defined in the applicable legislation and the requirements of the environmental management sy
stem based on the LST EN ISO 14001 
standard or the European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), or other equivalent en
vironmental management systems based on European Union or international standards, and the 
requirements for the supplied products to comply with the T
ype I eco-label (according to LST EN ISO 14024).  
The suppliers who follow the SCE must actively seek to conserve natural resources and contribute to the European Union’s goals o
f promoting circular economy
, seek to integrate energy e
fficienc
y
, 
environmental and recy
cling principles into their product design, including product packaging management issues, aim to reduce the amount of was
te generated by their activities, ensure its saf
e and 
responsible management
, reuse and recycling and seek to reduce electricity consumption and/
or use renewable energy sources to produce, supply and/
or use goods. 
W
aste management guidelines
 
These guidelines have been approved in each k
ey Group company to ensure sound waste management and utilisation process.

Resource utilisation initiativ
es
ESO (Networks) reuses resources in its activities. When reconstructing the network, we reuse parts of the old network materials (wires, metals, etc.). Also
, the company reuses the materials that 
arrive with the goods (box
es, pallets).  
While dismantling the unnecessar
y buildings of Ignitis Gamyba (R
eser
ve Capacities and Green Generation), we used some concrete demolition w
aste for lev
elling the company's roads. If the 
decommissioned device is suitable for reuse and there is a mark
et demand, we sell it through an open tender for further use. 
Fly and bottom ash and slag rec
ycling 
initiatives
W
e are exploring the possibilities to use hazardous fly ash from incinerated waste in the production of other products while applying the principles of indus
trial symbiosis (e.g., recovering 
useful materials – salts, metals that can be reused in o
ther industrial processes) and, thus, contributing to the development o
f circularity initiatives. The Group companies are interested in such 
technologies and are carrying out feasibility studies. 
W
e are planning to reuse bottom ash and slag, residue o
f incinerated was
te, in the roadworks as well as in the landfills for pa
ving access roads as an alternative to gravel. In 2023, about 55,740 
tonnes of bottom ash and slag were tr
ansferred for reusing purposes.  
Product as a service
The Group companies off
er their customers services that meet the principles of the circular economy and promote its dev
elopment
. Ser
vices such as www
.eparkai.lt
, a platform managed 
by Ignitis (Customers & Solutions), where customers can rent a part of a wind farm or a solar park, directly promote circularity
. This way
, the customer only receiv
es the service of the product
, 
but does not become the owner of it
. The customer does not need to worry about servicing, repairing or disposing of the product after the end of its lifec
ycle, and the owner (company) is 
interested in ensuring the lifespan of the product as long as possible b
y renewing it and investing in longer-las
ting products.
Ignitis (Customers & Solutions) also actively promotes the use o
f electric vehicles (EV) by dev
eloping solutions that allow fast and safe char
ging of EV
s. The company is also creating a public EV 
charging network. This wa
y
, the customers can use the service without becoming the owners of the product
. 
Repair
, renewal, auctions
Most of the Group companies try to repair and renew brok
en items first
, rather than buying new ones and throwing awa
y the old ones. IT equipment that is still opera
tional and can be reused 
but no longer suitable to the Group (becomes outdated and is not compatible with the new s
ystems) is sold at auctions. W
e hold regular auctions, where mobile phones and other computer 
equipment is sold to be reused. 
Separate collection of f
ood waste in the 
office f
or bioenergy production
From July 2022, in the headquarters of the Group (Laisvės A
ve. 10, Vilnius), food waste is being collected separ
ately and transferred to the biogas power plant for bioenergy production. The 
produced energy is sold on the mark
et
, and the funds received are donated to charities. In 2023 about 1.02 tonnes of organic kitchen waste were collected and 408 kWh o
f electricity was 
produced. In total, about 2.47 t of CO
2
-eq was av
oided.
Partnerships
The Group encourages its employ
ees to use refurbished second-hand IT equipment for personal needs and has signed a partnership agreement with a second-hand refurbished IT equipment 
provider
. Employees get discounts when they buy such IT equipment
.

OHS policy and management advancements
In our commitment to OHS, we have appointed dedica
ted personnel for eff
ective OHS implementation and coordination. 
W
e focus on analysing workplace incidents, deriving corrective actions from these analyses. 
Managers not only engage with employ
ees on OHS topics for improved saf
ety and satisfaction but also commence periodic meetings on OHS issues, emphasising its priority
. 
Furthermore, we have initiated tr
aining for new OHS committee members in the companies of the Group and de
veloped interactive OHS manuals, reinf
orcing our commitment to 
maintaining a safe and informed workplace
.
Focused risk assessment and prev
ention
W
e employ a thorough and systematic approach to identify potential hazards in the workplace. This involv
es evaluating various aspects of the work environment
, processes and 
equipment to ascertain any risks that could lead to accidents or health issues. Our risk assessment process is dynamic and continuously updated to reflect the changes in work 
practices or in regard to new information.
W
e meticulously record and analyse near misses, injuries and other accidents. This data is crucial for understanding the roo
t causes of incidents and for dev
eloping strategies to 
prevent their recurrence
. Our zero tolerance tow
ards intoxication a
t work policy is a testament of our commitment to maintain a saf
e and responsible work environment
.
Additionally
, the 'Days without accidents' calendar serves as an eff
ective tool to track our safety progress. It provides a clear and quantifiable measure of our safety performance, 
encouraging ongoing vigilance and continuous improvement o
f our safety practices.
Our OHS risk management also extends to training and preparedness. W
e conduct regular pre-emergency training sessions, equip our emplo
yees with the necessary skills and 
knowledge to respond eff
ectively in crises. 
Promoting safety aw
areness and communication
The Group is committed to enhance workplace s
afety through various initia
tives. 
W
e conduct regular health examinations for employ
ees and provide vaccinations at the company's e
xpense. 
The ‘2023: Occupational Safety Y
ear
’ campaign and the ‘Is it safe?’ program, launched in October 2022, were fundamental for promo
ting safety culture. The ‘Is it saf
e?’ section on 
our intranet serves as a hub for vital health and safety informa
tion. 
W
e actively involve employ
ees in shaping our safety practices through annual surveys and recognise their contributions in prof
essional mastery contests and internal competitions 
lik
e the ‘S
afest ESO team’ a
ward. 
Additionally
, our newsletters co
ver impor
tant health and safety topics, ensuring continuous awareness and educa
tion.
Employee f
ocused OHS training initiatives
The Group has deployed a robus
t OHS training for employ
ees, encompassing mandator
y sessions on safety practices and protocols. 
W
e regularly update our workforce with in-service training and retraining, while tracking their performance using a comprehensive monitoring database. 
One of our initiatives is a ‘Saf
ety W
eek’
, which is organised across all regions by ESO (Ne
tworks), emphasizing practical safety skills.
At Panev
ėžys T
raining Centre, we ha
ve trained ov
er 620 employees in high-risk work pro
tocols. 
Additionally
, we carr
y out specialized first aid and healthy posture tr
ainings, along with courses on managing dangerous substances and fire safety
, as par
t of our extensive health 
and safety education eff
orts.

.)
Enhancing workplace safety
The Group actively enhances workplace safety by ensuring compliant and secure work en
vironment and conducting regular inspections. 
W
e're innovating by tes
ting smart inspection solutions and visual OHS tools, including an IT and AI tool for real-time PPE surveillance tested at Kaunas CHP
.
Our ‘Not safe? R
eport!’ application, designed for immediate reporting of unsafe work environments and violations, fos
ters a responsive and proactive safe
ty culture.
Providing essential protective equipment is a priority
, which helps ensure staff s
afety in various scenarios. Up-to-da
te educational videos for visitors shown in high-risk areas, lik
e 
power plants, further our safety commitments.
W
e conduct trainings and campaigns on emergency evacuation, pedes
trian and driver safety and adapt our safety measures seasonally
.
Incident management and reporting
Accidents and health related incidents are registered and in
vestigated in accordance with the requirements o
f legal acts and the standard of inv
estigating and reporting accidents 
and incidents at work of the Group
. 
The incident investiga
tion procedure includes the following: obtaining the e
xplanations of the employ
ee and other colleagues who were present
, analysing statements on wha
t 
caused the incident
, drawing conclusions and applying preventive measures. The in
vestigation is then communica
ted to relevant stak
eholders (e.g., employ
ees who may also 
experience this type of incident
, also to management and supervisor
y bodies). If necessar
y
, employ
ees are provided with additional personal or collective protective equipment
.
The Group ensures the possibility to anonymously report OHS violations or incidents through the T
rust Line and protects the confidentiality of whistle-blowers. Reports are 
processed in accordance with the procedure established by the Group
’s internal legal acts.

#EnergySmartST
AR
T
The Group is addressing several challenges in the ener
gy sector
, including the low number of s
tudents enrolling in electrical and energy engineering studies and the aging 
workforce of engineers. Additionally
, there is a lack of awareness among students, the y
outh and the broader society about the energy sector
’s career prospects. 
T
o combat these issues, the Group continues de
veloping the #EnergySmartST
AR
T programme. This initia
tive aims to engage young people in the ener
gy field through activities 
at energy sites and voca
tional guidance in schools, increasing student employment in engineering positions during their studies and enhancing the sector’s perception as a viable 
career path.
Our actions include popularising the energy sector among students through school trips and lectures, off

Document / standard 
 
Description
Group Remunera
tion Policy
The policy was approv
ed by the General Meeting o
f Shareholders of the parent company and applies to all Group companies and 
employees. 
They k
ey provisions of the policy include the following: 
 
–
 
establishing unanimously correct
, clear and transparent principles of remunera
tion for employ
ees of the Group companies and the 
employee remuner
ation sys
tem based on them;
 
–
 
maintaining employee motiva
tion and meeting the shareholders’ expecta
tions for sustainable
, socially responsible development by 
creating a modern, international and competitiv
e company;
 
–
 
attr
acting and retaining competent
, fast-learning, technologically advanced, globally-minded and crea
tive employ
ees. 
For the eff
ective performance of the Supervisor
y Board’s functions and responsibilities in the field of remuneration, the Supervisory Board 
has set up a Nomination and R
emuneration Committee to assess and mak
e proposals on the Group’s long-term remuneration policy
, to moni-
tor the compliance of The Group Remuner
ation Polic
y with international and good governance pr
actices and to mak
e appropriate proposals 
for the improvement o
f the Remunera
tion Policy
. 
The Supervisor
y Board and the Nomination and Remunera
tion Committee ensure the pre
vention of conflicts of interest when making deci-
sions on the remuneration sy
stem.

Benefits
The standard is used to regulate additional measures for mo
tivating employ
ees. If the individual provisions of the standard are inconsistent 
with the provisions of a collective agreement concluded within a Group compan
y
, the provisions o
f the standard or the collective agreement 
that provide more fa
vourable conditions for emplo
yees shall apply to the employ
ees of that company

Employee e
xperience
The Group uses eNPS, which is a widely used metric to gauge employ
ee job satisfaction by measuring their willingness to recommend their company
. The sur
vey includes 
questions related to the clarity of informa
tion on career opportunities, awareness of organisational changes, the perceived v
alue of additional benefits, the ability to maintain work-
life balance and the utilisation of regular one-on-one meetings with managers. 
The Group started measuring eNPS in 2019, conducting quar
terly surveys with all employ
ees. The target set b
y the Group is to have ≥50% o
f employees promo
ting it as an 
employer
. In 2023 the Group maintained a high eNPS level at 57.5% (in 2022 – 61.8%). 
The survey revealed that maintaining work-life balance w
as the most challenging aspect in 2023. 
The results aid in identifying sensitive areas, facilitating continuous improvement in emplo
yee e
xperience and enhancing engagement
. Our plans include refining the sur
vey by 
incorporating additional research areas for more comprehensiv
e insights into employee e
xperience.
By sharing their opinions on internal processes, benefits and relationships, employ
ees contribute to the creation of a supportive work environment and, thus, benefit themselves. 
This, in turn, benefits the Group by fostering its fle
xibilit
y and a people-oriented approach, which leads to a better working en
vironment
.
Social protection
The Group provides comprehensive social protection through public progr
ammes and benefits to mitigate the impact of major life e
vents. 
Health insurance options provided b
y the Group vary across locations (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Finland), cov
ering preventive care, dental, ophthalmology
, outpatient 
and inpatient services and more. 
Additional benefits include sickness benefits, short-term illness leave
, wellness days and annual flu v
accinations. Employees receive unemployment bene
fits, personal accident 
insurance and parental leav
e benefits. 
Retirement bene
fits encompass contributions to pension funds and optional savings plans of employ
ees, with the state contributing to the 2
nd
 pension pillar in Lithuania. 
Additionally
, the Group grants financial suppor
t upon the birth or adoption of children and off
ers various payments based on specific family conditions.

tion on our social protection programmes and benefits.

Description
Group Occupational Health

y
The policy was approv

contractors and third parties to assess potential OHS risks at its facilities and other work sites while promoting a culture o
f s
afety and z
ero tolerance 
for violations. Our ov
erall objective is to maintain a safe and health
y working environment in accordance with our OHS policy
.
Every year
, we prepare plans for contr
actor inspections and carry them out at their workplaces. The main criterion is how safely the work is 
being performed. After the inspection, we prepare an inspection report and send it to the contractor
. If necessar
y
, we request to eliminate any 
deficiencies and discrepancies. 
Improving
engagement
T
o achiev
e the best results, the Group has initiated a review o
f contractor agreements and is employing diff
erent engagement methods:  
 
–
 
communication using newsletters; 
 
–
 
contractor reinforcement programme; 
 
–
 
contractor safety days; 
 
–
 
consultations, meetings; 
 
–
 
par
tner days and daily direct coopera
tion. 
ESO (Networks) conducts professional mas
tery competitions for contractors and employees separ
ately
. Star
ting in 2024, these competitions will be 
held to promote greater engagement among contractors' emplo
yees, learning, constructiv
e collaboration to share the best pr
actices. During these 
events, the best contr
actors are awarded, and errors made are analysed to pre
vent potential future incidents. 
Due diligence
The procurement contract awarded b
y a Group company to a supplier must specify the supplier's designated staff member who will be responsible 
for the contract
. The Group company cooperates with the supplier
, its person responsible and its staff be
fore concluding the procurement contract
, 
during its performance and at the end of the contract
. The regularity of cooperation depends on each procurement contract signed between a 
Group company and a supplier
. Additionally
, the Group regularly monitors the suppliers' compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract
.
The Group carries out periodic supplier assessments to evaluate if the
y adhere to the Supplier Code of Ethics (SCE). These assessments may involve 
visits to suppliers’ premises, with suppliers legally obligated to provide the necessary information. Failing to comply with contractual obliga
tions may 
result in penalties or contract termination. The Group has implemented five new improv
ement actions in 2023 to enhance its supply chain.
The Group actively engages with its supply chain through various means, including direct communication, sus
tainabilit
y events, consultations, 
meetings and individual invitations to participate in sustainability initiatives. 
Contract performance involves the identification o
f responsible individuals from both the Group and the supplier
. If concerns arise, suppliers can 
disclose them by contacting the Group's representa
tive.
Electronic instructions
In 2023, electronic instructions were introduced, which help reduce the administra
tive burden on the employ
ees supervising contractor work 
and provide the ability to control the work that untrained directors of work canno
t organise or perform on ESO’s (Networks) sites. Contractors 
then perform work at our objects according to the supervisor
’s instructions (in the electricity sector) and work orders (in the gas sector). These 
written task
s are entered into the Instruction Registra
tion Program based on the ‘Description of the process f
or carrying out work at the company's 
facilities based on instructions and orders' (link in Lithuanian) and ‘Description of the process f
or issuing and revoking work orders or work orders/
authorisations’ (link in Lithuanian).

Financial support
The financial support practice was started in 2022 by Ignitis Renewables (Green Generation), and in 2023 Kaunas CHP (Green Gener
ation) has also provided financial support for community projects. Generally
, 
we provide financial support for community projects and initiatives to contribute to the development of community infras
tructure, skills, ev
ents and other initiatives. Howe
ver
, our main goal of providing financial 
support to communities is empowering communities to confidently implement energy efficienc
y and renewable energy solutions in their lives.
Community engagement 
action plan
Community engagement is based on the mapped stak
eholder analysis, which includes understanding the stak
eholders’ interests in and the influence on the project and the role they may play
. Ignitis Renewables 
(Green Generation) follow
s a clear community engagement approach and develops community and stak
eholder engagement action plans with diff
erent strategies. 
Ignitis Renewables (Green Gener
ation) considers the views and interests o
f all stak
eholders by working individually with each stak
eholder on a project-by-project basis. In practice, community managers assist 
stak
eholders at various stages of the project’s lifec
ycle by tailoring the action plan based on the community's specific project needs and concerns.
Engagement channels and 
involvement
W
e take the views o
f community members into account when shaping and improving our sustainability activities as we are prioritising open and active communication.
W
e provide all public presentation participants with a feedback form and encourage them to evaluate the presenta
tion, leave their ques
tions or submit proposals. W
e analyse the feedback results afterw
ards 
and consider them when preparing further presentations on project planning.
W
e continuously assess stakeholders, giv
e them a choice to be directly or indirectly engaged through various communication methods and ask them if the
y agree to be involved in the project de
velopment
. 
Some stak
eholders preferred to be consulted during specific stages of the project development or inf
ormed later about the project
. As we use diff
erent engagement methods and strategies, the stak
eholders 
can engage at various project stages, making the process more e
fficient and targeted and reducing the unnecessary burdens on par
ticipants.
In Lithuania, in 2023 we engaged with communities located near our 6 new projects (in early development or in cons
truction phases) in municipalities of Jonav
a, Klaipėda district, Plungė, Pakruojis, K
elmė and 
T
auragė. The scope of community stak
eholders we directly engage with grew to 70 new organisations.  
Engagement timing
Community engagement starts as early as possible, typically in the design stage, where we try and reduce the majority of possible negative impacts of our renewable energy projects. 
In 2023, we started engaging with the seaside/
offshore e
xternal stak
eholders by starting and facilitating the dialogue, organising informal mee
tings and ex
changing information with the stak
eholders.

inclusion
Customer Experience Book
The book describes the principles of monitoring the performance of customer services at regular 
intervals in accordance with the service guidelines, processes, procedures, normative documents 
provided for therein, and assessing the impact of the deplo
yed sy
stems.
Health and Safety
, 
security of person-
related impacts 
Rules on safety in the operation o
f 
electrical installations (Instructions b
y 
the Minister of Energy o
f the Republic of 
Lithuania)
The rules establish the safety guidelines for electrical ins
tallations and apply to electricity producers, 
transmission and distribution network opera
tors, electrical installation opera
tors and electricity 
consumers. They also establish standards f
or electrical safety signs.
Internal safe energy guidelines
The guidelines are prepared by ESO (Networks) and provide comprehensiv
e safety instructions for 
working around electricity networks and other safe practices, emer
gency procedures for handling 
power outages, outline network protection zones and prohibited activities within them. The
y also 
provide information about the meaning and implica
tions of lightning warning signs.
Access to energy 
(guaranteed electricity 
and gas supply)
Conditions for the electricity (link in 
Lithuanian) and gas (link in Lithuanian) 
supply of the last resort and distribution 
services
ESO (Networks) has established a set o
f terms and conditions that define the procedures for the 
provision of electricity and gas supply of last resort and distribution services to its customers. These 
terms outline the mutual rights and responsibilities of both the customer and ESO (Ne
tworks), including 
pricing structures, payment me
thods and dispute resolution mechanisms.
Access to energy 
(disconnections) 
Internal guidelines for disconnecting 
indebted customers
Both ESO (Networks) and Ignitis (Customers & Solutions) ha
ve established guidelines for handling 
indebted customers. These guidelines outline a clear process for cus
tomers to address their 
debts, including specific deadlines, communication channels and the information to be pro
vided. 
Disconnecting a service is considered a last resor
t and is only implemented after all o
ther collection 
eff
or
ts hav
e failed. Additionally
, there are exceptions for sensitive and vulner
able groups and a specific 
list of customers who canno
t be disconnected due to the importance of their ser
vices to the public 
life.

of imbalances in the sys
tem due to imbalances 
between generation and consumption and in 
case of the disconnection of a major network or 
generation element
. mFRR balancing capacity is 
provided by two units of Kruonis PSHP (Green 
Generation) with a capacity of 369 MW;
 
–
 
the mFRR capacity is activated within 15 
minutes and balancing energy can be delivered 
in amount and duration according to the needs 
and requests of the TSO
. T
oday
, balancing 
services are sold in the Baltic electricit

power systems and manage the imbalances 
between generation and consumption across 
the Baltic control block.
–
 
voltage control services which are not related 
to the frequency regulation and balancing. It is 
provided by Kruonis PSHP’s (Green Genera

units operating in synchronous compensator 
mode while regulating the reactive power and 
voltage. The service is activated when the TSO 
lacks the capacity of voltage management 
facilities on the transmission network elements to

of Kruonis PSHP and Kaunas HPP
. They maintain 
the voltage in the transmission grid and supply the 
electricity needed to restore the electricity supply 
to Lithuanian consumers after an accident or a

, for unforeseen reasons, 
the Lithuanian electricity system must oper

Description 
Group Code of Ethics
The Code of Ethics of the Group is based on the values o
f our organisation and defines what ethical activity principles should be fol-
lowed by the Group companies and employ
ees.
The Code of Ethics delineates the organisation's approach to achie
ving goals, guiding interactions with colleagues and partners, and 
establishing standards for e
thical behaviour
. The Code of Ethics outlines the organisation's commitment to prioritizing respect and equal 
opportunities for employees, fostering a culture o
f s
afe work and dev
elopment
, promoting an open and fair mark
et
, upholding responsi-
bility and transparency
, and empowering and protecting par
tnerships.
Group Anti-Corruption Polic
y
The Anti-Corruption Polic
y is the Group's k
ey document for creating an anti-corruption en
vironment
, setting out the principles and obli-
gations for the creation o
f a transparent environment and the implementation, supervision, and control of the policy
. Employees working 
with the officials o
f foreign countries or operating in foreign countries must adhere to the principles o
f zero tolerance o
f corruption and 
to the provisions set out in the Anti-Corruption P
olicy
. The policy applies to the Group’s emplo
yees and business partners: contractors, 
suppliers, consultants, other partners and stak
eholders.
The policy is consistent not only with the principles o
f the United Nations Convention agains
t Corruption but also with the provisions of 
the Law on Prevention o
f Corruption. Additionally
, the policy is also compliant with the Anti-Corruption Management System Standard 
(ACMS). Furthermore, guidance and recommendations pro
vided by both the Council of Europe's Group of States Agains
t Corruption 
(GRECO) and the Organization for Economic Co-opera
tion and Development (OECD) were duly incorpora
ted into the policy
.

Methodology
GHG emissions
 are calculated by multiplying 
activity data by standard emission factors. The 
total amount of emissions is indicated in tonnes 
of CO
2
 equivalent (t CO
2
-eq). Data was obtained 
from commercial invoices or internal accounting 
systems. W
e use emission factors from official 
sources – Lithuanian national accounting reports 
and the Department for Environment
, Food and 
Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Specific emission factors are 
used for each source category
. Calculations are 
performed according to the standard approved 
by the Group. De
tailed information on the 
emission calculation methodology can be found 
on our website. 
GHGs are assessed according to their Global 
W
arming Potential (G
WP), which is calculated 
based on the warming potential of one 
kilogramme of gas compared to one kilogramme 
of CO
2
 over a period of one hundred y
ears. GWP 
of the main GHGs:
CO
2
 – 1
CH
4
 – 28
N
2
O – 265
SF
6
 – 23,500
NF
3
 – 16,100
Emissions per full day equiv
alent
 are calculated 
by dividing all emissions by full-time equiv
alent of 
Group employees.
When 
calculating electricity and heat energy 
production emissions per kWh produced
, 
only the production-related direct emissions are 
included, which are divided by the produced 
(gross) electricity and heat quantities.

–
 
direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)
. Scope 1 
emissions include natural gas and was
te used for 
energy production, gasoline and diesel used in 
vehicles and methane emissions resulting from 
losses in the distribution network. The emissions 
of stationary incinerators accounts for more 
than 83% of the total Scope 1 emissions. In 
2023, direct emissions decreased by almost 2% 
compared to 2022 due to the revised and updated 
methodology for calculating na
tural gas losses; 
 
–
 
indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2)
. Scope 2 
emissions include electricity and central heating 
consumed in the Group's activities and losses 
of the electricity distribution network. The main 
source of Scope 2 emissions was electricity 
purchased by Kruonis PSHP (Green Generation). 
Emissions from energy consumption in 2023 
decreased by 16% compared to 2022 due to 
lower electricity grid losses;
 
–
 
other indirect emissions (Scope 3)
. Scope 3 
emissions include all other indirect emissions of 
the Group's activities emitted b
y the sources that 
the Group does not control or own. Other indirect 
emissions include the emissions from:
 
–
 
purchased goods and services – third-par

emissions from manufacturing of the goods and 
services used by the Group in its operations 
(cat

Out of scope (biogenic) emissions
In order to ensure the full disclosure of emissions, 
we present biogenic emissions from renewable 
energy sources (CO
2
 emissions from the combustion 
of biomass and biodegradable fraction o
f waste) 
separately
. Emissions from energy production in 2023 
increased by 39% compared to 2022. This increase is 
due to Vilnius CHP waste-to-energy unit oper
ating at 
full capacity throughout the entire year
.

y adding up 
the diff
erent types of fuel used in the Group. In 
order to unify the measurement units, all values 
are converted to gigawatt hours.
Data was obtained from commercial in
voices or 
internal accounting systems.
T
o
tal energy consumption
 is calculated b
y 
adding the consumed fossil fuel, consumed 
renewables fuel, energy purchased for internal 
use, electricity generated b
y our own assets and 
subtracting the sold heat and electricity
.
Due to the data reliability issues, the electricity 
produced by the wind farms and consumed 
internally is not included, which mak
es up an 
insignificant part.

Methodology
Accumulated energy sa
vings of final consumers
 
are estimated and calculated based on the actual 
data: after ins
talling energy saving measures, 
the consumption diff
erence is calculated by 
1) multiplying it by the coefficient appro
ved 
in the agreement (5%), while considering the 
consumer’s own consumption and GDP growth 
indicators or 2) calculating the factual diff
erence 
of energy sav
ed while also factoring in the unused 
energy
. The Group companies have submitted 
their reports to the Lithuanian Energy Agency for 
verification, howev
er
, we e
xpect changes since 
the related agreements will hav
e to be changed 
according to the corrections to the energy savings 
methodology suggested by the Group
. The 
lifecy
cle of the measure is also being assessed, i.e
., 
how long does the installed measure maintains its 
savings eff
ect
. Here we present the annual savings 
eff
ect
, while the estimate of the savings until 2030 
is provided in the disclaimer below
.
Savings in energy supplied to customers
 are 
calculated for each of the measures pro
vided for 
in the agreements: the energy supplied by the 
supplier is multiplied by the savings coefficients 
of diff
erent educational and consulting measures 
determined in the Description of the Ener
gy 
Savings Calculation and Maintenance Procedure 
for Measures to Increase Energy Efficienc
y 
(Order of the Minister of Ener
gy of the Republic 
of Lithuania of 5 December 2016 No
. 1-320). It is 
considered that the measure has been properly 
implemented if the supplier has created all 
the opportunities for the entire audience of its 
customers to see the information promo
ting 
energy efficienc
y
. Here we present the cumulativ
e

 Only the amount of energy generated b
y those facilities that actually emit emissions was used to calculate the emission intensity indicator (i.
e., electricity from hydropower plants and wind farms is not 
included).
Emissions threshold values are set b
y Environmental 
Protection Agency in IPPC permits. Compliance with 
IPPC permits is assured at sever
al levels: emissions 
are continuously measured by continuous emission 
monitoring systems and the En
vironmental Protection 
Agency has access to the monitoring sys
tem (in case 
of any devia
tions, the monitoring system sends a 
notification), Environmental Pro
tection Department 
carries out periodical onsite inspections and the 
implemented ISO14001:2015 standard ensures the 
compliance with the environmental aspects. 
Pollution
There were 13 environmental inspections in 2023 
during which no major inconsistencies were 
identified. In early 2023, a discrepancy in our 
emission sources was identified by us during the 
internal inventory as one pollutant at one facility was 
not covered b
y our IPPC permits. Consequently
, we 
compensated for ex
cess pollution costs in 2022 and 
updated our IPPC permit

. W
ater withdrawal, reuse and 
discharge data is obtained from the companies' 
performance data files. The data is track
ed 
and recorded by the companies’ employ
ees 
responsible for environmental issues by 
monitoring the water meter readings, applying the 
water quantity calculation methodologies or the 
data is obtained from the utility bills provided to 
the companies (in leased objects).
W
ater consumption
 is calculated b
y subtracting 
the water discharged (e
xcept surface rainwater) 
from the water withdra
wn (ex
cept hydropower 
and cooling water as it is withdra
wn but reused). 
T
o
tal water withdra
wal has decreased mainly due to 
the less surface water used for hy
dropower plants. 
T
o
tal water consumption has been decreasing o
ver 
the past three years mainly due to lower withdr

Groundwater from our own wells is used in the units 
belonging to Ignitis Gamyba (Reserve Capacities 
and Green Generation) – Kruonis PSHP (Green 
Generation) and Elektrėnai Comple
x (Reserve 
Capacities). The majority of the water tak
en from 
the municipal water supply is used in Vilnius CHP 
and Kaunas CHP (both Green Generation). About 
172,113m
3
 of condensate formed during the 
production process was reused in Vilnius CHP (Green 
Generation), thus saving w
ater resources. The largest 
amount of the water withdr
awn for consumption 
is from the municipal water supply
. About 99% of

 A solar park in T
auragė is situated in the same area as an e
xisting wind farm and started its operations in 2023.
Methodology 
Occupied area
The area occupied by the distribution networks 
was calculated after per
forming an area analysis 
in the geo-informational sy
stems of the Networks 
segment
. The area includes the object and its 
buff
er protection zone.
The area occupied by wind farms is calculated 
by summing up the protection z
one of each wind 
farm where the land use is changed (0.15 ha).
Data on the area of other objects are tak
en from 
lease agreements or official documents where the 
actual area of the buildings is registered.
The Group’s genera
tion facilities operate in Lithuania, 
Estonia and Poland, we also ha
ve administrative and 
other ancillary facilities in Lithuania, Latvia, Poland 
and Finland. In addition, we manage electricity and 
natural gas distribution ne
tworks in the territory of 
Lithuania, covering an area of more than 100,000 
ha, not only in urbanised, but also in natural areas. A
t 
the end of 2023, the total area of land used b
y Ignitis 
Group was more than 102,000 ha, with more than half 
of it located in or near natur
al habitats (hy
droelectric 
power plants, electricity and natural gas distribution 
networks in forested areas, e
tc.).
Occupied land
. 
The The indicator shows the 
proportion of territories that have been con
verted 
but does not show the quality of the territory before 
the conversion. The area of the Group
’s generation 
facilities covers 740 ha (of which 98% belongs to 
the Group by right of ownership), administr
ative and 
other purpose premises – around 6.6 ha (almost all 
are leased), electricity distribution networks with 
protection zones co
ver more than 100,000 ha (of 
which more than 6% – underground cables with 
protection zones). Judging only b
y the length of 
the power lines themselves, more than 34% are 
underground, and underground power lines require 
smaller protection zones, which means less a
ff
ected 
areas of the natural en
vironment
.
It is important to take into account tha
t some 
conversions of na
tural habitats occurred long bef
ore 
the creation of the national s
ystem of pro
tected 
areas or the assessment of the significance of the 
landscape and habitats. The hy
droelectric power 
plants managed by the Group were planned and 
built when Lithuania was occupied by the USSR in the 
second half of the 20th century
, before the s
ystem of 
protected areas in Lithuania was formed:
 
–
 
Kaunas HPP (Green Generation) – construction 
started in 1955, the Nemunas river was dammed, 
and the hydroelectric power plant s
tarted 
operations in 1959;
 
–
 
Kruonis PSHP (Green Generation) – construction 
started in 1978, the operation of the pumped-
storage hy
droelectric power plant star
ted in 1992.
Therefore
, the habitat conversions made during the 
construction of these objects ov
er a long period 
of time became the new ecosys
tems, which now 
belong to the Kaunas Lagoon Regional Park, a 
national protected area that preserves the unique 
landscape of the largest artificial water body in 
Lithuania, its natural ecosy
stem and cultural heritage 
values.

 An environmental impact assessment covered a 77 ha area, with only 35 ha utilised during the construction in 2023.
Methodology 
Distances to protected areas
 are obtained in 
two ways: calcula
ted using cartographic material 
(Natura 2000 Network Viewer) and measuring 
distances or tak
en from official documents o
f 
environmental impact assessment procedures.
Distance to areas of high ecological v
alue
. During 
the environmental impact assessment or screening 
of environmental impact assessment of the planned 
economic activity
, the distances to the pro
tected 
areas (national and international) and the potential 
impact on them are assessed. As already mentioned 
earlier
, Kaunas HPP (Green Gener
ation) and Kruonis 
PSHP (Green Generation) were built bef
ore the 
creation of a network of pro
tected areas in Lithuania, 
and the artificial water body (Kaunas Lagoon) was 
formed more than 60 years ago
. 
The indicator showcases which objects hav
e a higher 
expected impact on biodiversity because they are 
located a short distance from (or are located in) the 
areas of high ecological value
.

1
 Share of the area occupied by the Networks in areas of high ecological v
alue was calculated in 2022 during the analysis of the Group's impact on biodiversity and ecosy
stems. Since the Group's activities 
have not changed, the v
alues of the indicator in 2023 did not change, with slight variations in the r
atio of the area of ov
erhead and underground lines due to the replacement of ov
erhead lines with 
underground cables by the Group.
Methodology 
Share of the area occupied by the Networks in 
areas of high ecological value
 is calcula
ted by 
adding the area of the network and its protection 
zones and identifying their share in areas of high 
ecological value
. GIS lay
ers of ESO (Networks) 
distribution networks and publicly a
vailable GIS 
lay
ers of forests, Ramsar
, UNESCO, Na
tura 2000 
and other areas from official sources were used 
for calculations. 
Occupied land
 in the areas of high ecological value
. 
W
e present the land occupied by electricity and 
natural gas distribution ne
tworks with protection 
zones in areas of high ecological v
alue separately 
due to the specifics of their geographical distribution. 
Even though the spread of electricity and natural 
gas distribution networks ov
er the landscape is 
particularly large (length – more than 127,000 
km), only 1.7% of the total area of ne
tworks with 
protection zones is loca
ted in natural habitats o
f 
European Community impor
tance, 0.01% – in 
reservations (national protected areas of the s
trictest 
protection regime), 4.4% oof the network is located 
in Natura 2000 areas, 0.1% – in UNESCO and 0.3% – 
in Ramsar areas. It is impor
tant to note that the land 
occupied in diff
erent areas of high ecological value 
cannot be combined as these areas may o
verlap 
(e.g., Natur
a 2000 may include national pro
tected 
areas, forests, etc.).
As for the area occupied by electricity and natural 
gas distribution networks in the IUCN habitat 
classification areas, the largest area o
f the habitat 
networks geographically relev
ant to the Group is 
in forests – almost 0.3% o
f the forest area, of which 
0.07% is in k
ey habitats.
Please note that the networks are loca
ted only in the 
territory of Lithuania.

 The number of species in this category is preliminary due to possibilit
y that not all L
C species were listed in EIA documents.
Methodology 
Protected species
 in the environment of the 
Group’s facilities are identified on the basis of 
Environmental Impact Assessment or screening 
for an environmental impact assessment 
document
, which lists the valuable characteristics 
of the territories, including protected species.
Protected species
. 
The Group inevitably opera
tes 
in wildlife areas, where there may also be habita
ts of 
protected species. When planning any new object 
or the expansion of an e
xisting one, an environmental 
impact assessment or screening for an environmental 
impact assessment is carried out in accordance 
with the procedure established by legal acts, during 
which sensitive species in the vicinity of the planned 
activity are identified and, when relevant
, measures 
to reduce or compensate the impact are applied. W
e 
performed a preliminar
y analysis of the protected 
species located in the vicinity of the Group’s 
operational objects and classified the species 
according to the International Union for Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN) categories. Among the species o

Please note that
, as already mentioned, some of the 
Group’s facilities (hy
droelectric power plants) were 
built before the identification o
f valuable properties 
and the formation of the s
ystem of pro

Other cases are related to ensuring access to 
electricity supply for the society – the electricity 
distribution network is built both in fores

protected areas, but we tak
e into account the most

Methodology 
W
e disclose ha
zardous and non-hazardous 
waste categories toge
ther with their largest 
subcategories.
The waste genera
ted 
in each company of 
the Group is recorded and accounted for by 
the companies' employees responsible f
or 
environmental issues, who collect and store it in 
the Unified Product
, Packaging and Was
te Record 
K
eeping Information Sys
tem (PPWIS). 
The incinerated was
te to ash ratio
 is calculated 
by adding all the fixed annual amounts o
f waste 
incinerated by Vilnius CHP and Kaunas CHP (bo
th 
Green Generation) and dividing them by the to
tal 
amounts of generated fly and bo
ttom ash.  
The largest amounts of hazardous waste (fly ash) 
and non-hazardous waste (bottom ash and slag) 
are generated in Vilnius CHP and Kaunas CHP 
(both Green Generation). The lar
gest share of iron 
and steel waste is gener
ated by Ignitis Gamyba 
(Reserve Capacities and Green Generation) and ESO 
(Networks) companies. 
The Group companies are implementing various 
waste reuse initiativ
es, but more detailed information 
is only av
ailable for the bottom ash and slag. In 2023 
about 55,740 tonnes of bottom ash and slag were 
transferred f
or reusing. W
e plan to star
t looking for 
way
s to monitor the amount of waste reused in more 
detail and reveal the inf
ormation in future reports. 
The waste genera
ted by the Group’s companies is 
sorted and transferred to waste managers. Currently
, 
only Elektrėnai Complex (R
eserve Capacities), par
tly 
Ignitis Gamyba (Reserve Capacities and Green 
Generation) and partly ESO (Networks) track the 
information of the end o
f the lifecy
cle of the waste 
transferred to w
aste managers. The companies track 
how much is recycled, how much is used f
or energy 
generation, how much is disposed of in a landfill or 
composted. It represents 3% of all was
te generated 
by the Group. W
e plan to start following this process 
in more detail in other Group
’s companies and reveal 
the information about the lifec
ycle of managed w

 L
TIR – lost time injur

 TRIR – total recordable injury rate per million hours work
ed.
Methodology 
Lost time incident rate (L
TIR)
 is the number of 
accidents (injuries) which lead to temporary 
incapacity for work per million hours work
ed. The 
hours work
ed means the total hours work
ed by 
full-time employees during the y
ear
. Accidents 
(injuries) are events that lead to incapacity for 
work for one (including the day o
f the event) or 
more days.
T
o
tal recordable injury rate (TRIR)
 is calculated 
using the same methodology as L
TIR. Unlik
e L
TIR, 
when calculating TRIR, the number of injuries 
also includes those injuries where the injured 
person is able to work the day after the accident
. 
The data comes from internal registers, which 
are continuously updated. TRIR is calculated for 
employees o
f the Group.
The lost time incident rate (L
TIR) in 2023 decreased 
by almost 38% compared to 2022 and was 0.79.
The total recordable injury rate (TRIR) in 2023 was 
0.79 and was 53% lower than in 2022. Employ
ee 
safety remains our top priority
. The Group
's 
Management Board declared 2023 the ‘Y
ear o
f 
Safety’ and launched the ‘Is it safe?’ OHS programme 
across all companies. Our focus is on enhancing 
the safety culture, r
aising awareness and promoting 
cooperation among employ
ees and contractors for 
safe and healthy work. 
The Group initiated the calculation of the contr
actor 
TRIR indicator in July 2022. As a result
, the contractor 
TRIR indicator is applicable only for the full y
ear of 
2023. During 2023, the Group experienced a total o
f 
7 TRIR cases among the working contractors, with 6 
injuries classified as mild and 1 as severe
.

ormation about our employ
ees’ health

Methodology
Employee da
ta, including parental leave da
ta,
 
is collected in the Group’s personnel registr
ation 
system.
Retention r
ate
 is calculated by applying the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 401 standard 
requirements. 
In Lithuania parental leave dur
ation can be chosen 
by the employ
ee. The dura
tion determined by law is 
from 1 to 3 years. Besides, ev
ery family can choose 
who tak
es the parental leave (mother
, father or even a 
grandparent). Theoretically
, all employees that work 
in Lithuania can tak
e parental leave. Emplo
yee can 
also choose when to return to work anytime in the 
3-year period. The number abov
e shows the status 
quo, how many emplo
yees took parental lea
ve in 
2023 and how many hav
e returned from it (regardless 
of the year the
y took it).

 Only employees registered in Lithuania were included in the indica
tor calculations.

 Data for year 2021 is no

Methodology
The share of employ
ees using benefits 
(%) is 
calculated by including all the employ
ees who 
work
ed at the end of the financial year
, had the 
right to choose benefits and made their choices. 
Employees with the right to choose bene
fits are 
those employees whose proba
tionary period (3 
months) has already ended.
Starting from 2023, an additional benefit
, a MELP 
limit
, has been introduced to the store alongside 
health insurance, additional pension accumula
tion 
and education. This highly flexible bene
fit allows 
employees to spend the limit on selected goods or 
services from the MELP e-store, or they can choose 
to donate their limit
. This new benefit has quickly 
gained popularity
, ranking second, while health 
insurance remains the most fa
voured. In third place is 
supplementary voluntar
y pension accumulation (3rd 
pillar pension funds). As of the end of 2023, nearly 
10% of employ
ees have no
t yet opted for additional 
benefits.
1
 The number includes individuals opting for additional benefits accumulation from June 2023 to December 2023 as emplo
yees choose benefits in June–July f
or the next 12 months. At the end o
f the reporting 
period, some employees ma
y no longer work at the Group.

 MELP – a web-based platform for eff

 In 2023, a new additional benefit
, the 'free to choose' limit
, has been introduced alongside the existing options in the MELP benefit store

Methodology
Employee e
xperience sur
vey (eNPS – Employ
ee 
Net Promoter Score)
 is conducted once a 
quarter in the Group. All Group employees are 
invited to participate in the survey
. Employ
ees 
indicate on a scale of 1 to 10 how much they 
agree with the statement: “I would recommend 
my company as a potential workplace to 
my friend or a good acquaintance.
” The 
recommendation index is calcula
ted from the 
percentage of persons who would recommend 
the employer minus the percentage o
f persons 
who wouldn’t
.
While monitoring employee engagement and 
satisfaction, the Group has been conducting a 
quarterly employee experience assessment survey 
since 2019, which forms a comprehensive picture 
of how employ
ees feel at v
arious stages of our 
company's operations. Emplo
yees are ask
ed whether 
they would recommend the company to their 
acquaintances, and the result of the answers to this 
question indicates the eNPS (Employ
ee Net Promoter 
Score). Compared to 2022, this indicator decreased 
by 4.3 pp. A score abo
ve 50% is considered 
ex
cellent
. 
1
 eNPS survey was started in Q4 2019.
2
 Performance reviews, which include setting, re
viewing and evaluating achie
ved goals, are performed in our organisation once or twice a year

Methodology
The indicator of share of women in top 
management positions 
includes the level of 
management bodies, company managers and 
their direct subordinate managers. If the same 
person holds more than one position in the same 
company
, only one position is counted. The 
percentage of women in those positions is then 
calculated.
The objectives set in the Group
's strategic plan 
include an objective for ≥35% of management 
positions to be occupied by women. Meeting this 
ambitious objective requires additional steps in order 
to achieve a better gender balance in the Group
. It 
also requires us to revise our culture and leadership 
values and ensure they allow women to thriv
e in the 
organisation.

Methodology
The Group's total salary fund in 2023 amounted 
to EUR 136.7 million. In 2021, the formula for 
calculating the salary fund has changed – the 
leave
, the pension reser
ve and the capitalisation 
of salary have been added. 
The table shows the remuneration r
atio of women 
to men, with aver
age remuneration conv
er
ted to 
full-time equivalent
. 
The presented remuneration ra
tio between 
men and women does not account for other 
factors that influence the level o
f remuneration 
(e.g., general situa
tion in the energy sector
, 
qualifications, work experience) and is solely 
based on gender
.
A
verage monthly contractual remuneration is 
converted to full-time equivalent (FTE).
The purpose of the Group Remuner
ation Polic
y 
is to guarantee internal fairness and to av
oid any 
discrimination. 
The Group's remunera
tion structure is based on 
two essential documents: Remuneration P
olicy 
and Remunera
tion Guidelines. The Remunera
tion 
Policy se
ts out the basic principles and material 
provisions for the management and structure o
f 
remuneration, while the R
emuneration Guidelines is 
a supporting document detailing the provisions of 
the Remunera
tion Policy (e
.g., setting and e
valuating 
objectives, determining and disbursing short-term 
incentives). Both documents are integra
ted and apply 
to all companies of the Group. F
or fur

see section ‘5. Remunera
tion’

Methodology
The aver
age number of training hours per 
employee
 is calcula
ted by recording all training 
hours and dividing them by all employ
ees. T
raining 
data is collected in the internal HR registers. The 
actual headcount at the end of the y
ear is used for 
the calculation.
T
rainings include all additional trainings ordered 
by employ
ees and trainings initiated by the HR. 
Mandatory trainings, such as fire safety
, work 
procedures, etc., are considered as briefings and 
are not included in the number of trainings. Also
, 
all online courses were not included in training 
indicators.
Based on the Group People and Culture P
olicy
, 
we encourage continuous employ
ee growth. The 
employees f
ollow the main principles of employ
ee 
education and training defined in the polic
y
. Also
, 
employees with the help o
f their direct managers 
mak
e their own annual grow
th plans, establishing 
growth objectives, duration, measures and a clear 
achievable result
. Compared to 2022, the number 
of employ
ees who participated in trainings in 2023 
increased by 17%, which demonstra
tes employee 
engagement and willingness to improve
.
1
The percentage is higher due to the counting of employees who participated in the trainings throughout the financial y
ear
, including those who left, thus exceeding the year-end headcount
.
2
 As the percent change is undefined when there is 0 in calculation, we chose to show 100 % change if there is increase from any number to 0.

Methodology
The aver
age grid connection time
 is calculated 
as the time to connect new electricity customers 
by adding up the duration o
f individual 
connection processes. The information is 
collected from the Group’s internal sy
stem.
Share of new connections meeting the deadline 
includes the share of new connections that did 
not ex
ceed the set connection deadline.
Production-based av
ailability
 is calculated as 
the ratio of actual production to the possible 
production, which is the sum of lost production 
and actual production in a given period. The 
production-based av
ailability is impacted by wind 
turbine outages, which are technical production 
losses. PBA is not impacted by mark
et-requested 
shutdowns and wind farm curtailments as these 
are due to external factors. 
The load factor 
is calculated as the ratio be
tween 
the actual generation ov
er a period relative to 
the potential generation, which is possible b
y 
continuously exploiting the maximum capacity 
over the same period. 
Wind speeds
 for the areas where Ignitis 
Renewables onshore wind farms are loca

measured on site at the wind turbine hub height
.
The aver
age grid connection time duration has scale 
down due to technical conditions and the decreased 
duration of the applica

, which 
was caused by a lower number of applica

 The test on our Code of Ethics is an integrated part of the anti-corruption knowledge tes
t
. 
In 2023, the share of employ
ees who state that the
y 
do not tolerate corrup
tion has increased. 
The result of the anti-corruption survey is directly and 
indirectly influenced by many diff
erent factors, both 
internal and external, for e
xample:
 
–
due to a constant turnover o
f employees, 
new arrivals to the Gro
up companies ma
y not 
have de
veloped the same level of anti-corrup
tion 
awareness as other e
xisting employees; 
 
–
 
in public spaces, various types of communication, 
pre-trial investiga
tions and court decisions related 
to corruption, especially those where individuals 
suspected of corruption are either acquitted 
due to insufficient e
vidence or convicted and 
imprisoned for corrupt acts, can significantly 
impact the employees and influence their 
willingness to report corruption;
 
–
 
 seemingly unrelated things lik
e rising prices, 
inflation, wage ra
tes, employee sentiment and 
even mood at the time o
f the survey also have an 
impact; 
 
–
 
it should also be noted that this survey has a certain 
margin of error
.
In summary
, the survey results reflect the momentary 
opinion and attitude o
f employees toward no
t 
tolerating corruption, and this a
ttitude can change 
depending on various factors.

Methodology
The share of employ
ees who participated in 
the training
 is measured by calculating the r
atio 
between the employees in
vited to participate 
in the training and the employ
ees who actually 
participated. T
rainings are registered in internal HR 
registers. The actual headcount at the end of the 
year was used f
or the calculation.
Reports received via the 
T
rust Line
 are registered 
in the Group’s JIRA register
, processed in 
accordance with the procedure established in 
the Group’s internal legal acts and inv
estigated 
in accordance with the rules of the internal 
investiga
tion commission approved by the Group
.
In 2023, following the customer reports, one 
personal data security violation was identified, 
requiring the Group company to report it to the 
State Data Protection Inspector
ate. A
dditionally
, 155 
personal data security breaches were identified, 
primarily attributed to human errors or cus
tomer 
faults (outdated data), resulting in partial disclosure 
of personal data. In 2023, the goal was se
t for all 
employees o
f the Group companies to undergo 
personal data protection training and pass the 
knowledge test
. Over 79 percent of the employ
ees 
successfully passed the test
.
W
e received a total of 233 reports via the T
rust 
Line. Most o
f them were related to the quality of 
the services provided and were transferred to the 
customer service. W
e measure the maturity and 
reliability of our services by the fact that we receive 
fewer and fewer reports. The number of received 
reports in 2023  decreased by 35% comparing to 
2022. After de
tailed inspections of the received 
information, 33 reports about possible electricity 
theft, possible cases o
f corruption, improperly 
performed works by employ
ees or contractors were 
confirmed.

Methodology
Suppliers audited for compliance with the 
Supplier Code of Ethics.
 Suppliers were selected 
for the assessment of compliance with Suppliers 
Code of Ethics provisions based on the following 
criteria:
a) Suppliers whose value of procurement 
contracts in Group companies is the largest and a
t 
least one concluded contract is v
alid for at least 6 
months from the start of the planned assessment 
of suppliers. Only those suppliers whose one or 
more procurement contract was signed after 1 
of August 2021 were included in the scope of 
inspected suppliers.
b) The total value o
f the procurement contracts of 
the selected suppliers in the Group company(s) 
is not less than 95 percent of the total v
alue of the 
procurement contracts of the suppliers.
Procurement indicators
 are calculated in a same 
way – dividing the v
alue of each indicator by the 
value of all procurements. The da
ta is tak
en from 
the Group’s internal procurement sy
stems.
A total of 58% of the suppliers in
vited to tak
e par
t in 
the assessment responded to the Supplier Code of 
Ethics compliance monitoring questionnaire. 
The share of the Group's green procurement in 
2023 increased by 6 percent compared to 2022 
and reached 100 percent
. Since 2022, the Group 
has been actively implementing socially responsible 
procurement practices and, during the reporting

period, socially responsible procurement accounted 
for more than half of all public procurement

year

Revenue
 
associated
 
with 
electricity
 
generation
 from wind 
power and 
hydropower is mainly related 
to the sales of 
electricity, whereas part of it was sold v
ia
 
C
ustomers 
&
 
Solutions
 
segment
 
(intra-group
 sales). 
However, 
revenue related with these intra-group sales was not 
eliminated from the numerator, considering that it 
refers to electricity produced using technologies 
that meet the technical s
creening
 
criteria
 
of
 
the
 
EU 
Taxonomy
 
Regulation

segment’s
 
result,
 w
hereas
 
the 
electricity
 
supply
 
(relevant
 
Customers
 & 
Solutions 
segment’s figures) was represented as being not 
eligible. The same logic has been applied to other 
transactions where necessary while ensuring that 
there is no double counting.       
Calculation
 
of
 
Taxonomy-eligible/aligned 
Taxonomy CAPEX  
As it is defined in the EU Commission Delegated 
Regulation 2021/2178, the share of the Group’s 
Taxonomy-eligible/aligned
 
CAPEX
 
is
 
calculated 
as the CAPEX related to assets or processes 
associated
 
with
 
Taxonomy-eligible/aligned 
economic activities as a proportion of the total 
Group’s Taxonomy CAPEX, which is calculated 
based on IAS 16 (73: I (i) and (iii)), IAS 38 (1
18: (e) (i)), 
IAS 40 (76: (a)), and IFRS 16 (53: (h)) (see section '8

Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible/aligned 
revenue

follo
ws, based on
 the cir
cumstances: 
–
 
If the asset has become operational during the 
reported financial period, T
axonomy-aligned 
CAPEX related to e
xpansion was repor
ted under 
‘T
ax
onomy CAPEX A
’
. 
–
 
If the expansion has not been completed in the 
year 2023 and the project was included in the 
T
a
xonom
y CAPEX plan (see part ‘T
axonom
y 
CAPEX Plan 2023’ below), T
axonomy-aligned 
CAPEX was reported under ‘T
a
xonom
y CAPEX B
’
. 
–
 
If the T
axonom
y CAPEX was rela
ted to T
axonomy-
aligned activities, but the project development 
phase is too early to provide necessary 
description, this T
axonomy CAPEX w
as treated as 
T
a
xonom
y-eligible but not aligned. 
–
 
If the taxonomy CAPEX is rela
ted to activities 
where the amount of inves
tment is small or 
fractional and, therefore
, the timeframe to become 
partially
/fully operational is short (e.g. electricity 
network expansion/
maintenance, EV network 
expansion, smart meter inves
tments, etc.), it was 
reported under ‘
T
axonomy CAPEX A
’
, assuming 
that 1) there is no or insignificant risk of non-
completion and 2) compliance with the technical 
screening criteria (TSC) is determined through 
the general assessment of the T
axonomy-eligible 
activities.

Other
 
minor
 
changes are related to a more precise assessment of 
intercompany transactions, adjustments
 related to a 
more precise allocation of revenue, Adj. EBITDA, 
Taxonomy OPEX and CAPEX in the numerator.
L
imitations
 
There
 
are
 
Taxonomy-eligible/aligned
 
activities 
in the Group which are not significant in terms o
f 
financial
 
numbers
 
and
 
whose
 
figures
 
cannot
 be 
clearly separated, therefore, the Group did n
ot 
include
 
those
 
figures
 
in
 
the
 
numerator
 
while 
calculating
 
KPIs
 
for
 
these
 
activities.
 
For 
instance: 
–
 
The share of T
a
xonom
y OPEX/CAPEX related 
to an acquisition and ownership of buildings is 
associated only with buildings rented out for the 
third parties and does not include operating/
capital expenses of adminis
tration buildings as the 
majority of administration buildings used b
y the 
Group are rented, and the residual is immaterial 
and/
or an integral part of generation units. 
–
 
Another limitation refers to tr
ansport vehicles 
which are mostly owned by one company in the 
Group (the figures are reported under the activit
y 
‘6.5 T
ransport by motorbik
es, passenger cars and 
light commercial vehicles’), however some o
ther 
companies also own several v
ehicles. Due to 
the complexity of the separa
tion, we classify the 
financial figures related to these single vehicles as 
T
a
xonom
y-non-eligible. Howev
er
, it must be noted 
that the related figures are not significant
.
There are also temporary limitations to the T
ax
onomy 
OPEX calculations, which include the following:
–
 
Due to the lack of industry specific guidelines 
and precise allocation tools within the Group’s 
accounting system, we canno
t objectively 
evaluate the type of IT maintenance cost that 
could be justifiably included; thus, we use
 a 
conservative approach and include all IT 
maintenance costs to the denominator but do 
not include any costs to the numerator.
–
 
Due to the same reasons, operational expenses 
related to the cost of emplo
yees servicing the 
assets to ensure the functioning of these assets are 
not included neither in the numerator
, nor in the 
denominator
. This approach was also applied for 
the repairs & maintenance expenses of tr
ansport 
vehicles, which, due to a few limitations o
f the 
current accounting system, canno
t be separated 
from the related expenses tha
t are not under 
the scope of T
axonomy OPEX. However
, it is 
not expected tha
t this addition would have a 
significant impact at the Group level.

e were:   
 
–
 
the decrease in revenue of T
axonomy-non-eligible 
activities (EUR -1,558.2 million), which was majorly 
driven by lower rev
enue from electricity and 
natural gas supply due to the drop in mark
et prices 
and volumes supplied; 
 
–
 
the increase was partly offse
t by the decrease 
in i) revenue (EUR -137.7 million) from stor
age of 
electricity
, electricity generation from h
ydropower 
and wind power (T
axonomy-aligned activities) 
due to lower captured electricity prices, and 
ii) revenue (EUR -74.6 million) of electricity 
transmission and distribution (T
axonomy-aligned 
activity), mostly due to lower revenue from the 
transmission of electricity due to lower tariffs se
t 
by the regulator

compared to 2022. The increase was mostly 
related to the electricity distribution activities, 
mainly due to the increased costs of both 
contractor fees and materials (full y

2023); 
 
–
 
in 2023 short-term lease expenditures associated

transaction made by Reserve Capacities
